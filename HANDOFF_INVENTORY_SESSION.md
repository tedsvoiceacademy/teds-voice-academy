## For Main Build Sessions

**Read this file instead:** `HANDOFF_RESOURCE_INVENTORY.md`

That file contains the complete resource map, Ted's decisions, file locations, technical notes, and prioritized build action items. It is the definitive reference for all resource files.

*This file (HANDOFF_INVENTORY_SESSION.md) was the original scope document for the inventory session. It has been replaced by HANDOFF_RESOURCE_INVENTORY.md as the active reference.*
