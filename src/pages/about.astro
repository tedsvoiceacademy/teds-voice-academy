  <!-- Intro Section -->
  <section class="intro-section">
    <div class="container container-narrow">
      <p class="intro-text">
        I've been singing since I was eight years old. I started teaching in 1988. In the decades since, I've worked with thousands of singers and speakers — in classrooms, rehearsal halls, private studios, and on stages around the country.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-text">
        What keeps me going? I believe authentic connection is the foundation of human experience. When we communicate from a place of truth, we inspire trust, foster understanding, and create relationships that matter.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-text">
        I do this work because I believe your authentic voice is your most powerful asset. My purpose is to help you uncover and embrace your true voice — whether through singing, speaking, or professional communication — so you can express yourself confidently, connect deeply with others, and lead with impact.

  <!-- My Path Section -->
  <section class="path-section">
    <div class="container container-narrow">
      <h2>How I got here</h2>
      
      <p>I fell in love with the voice early — and that love has only deepened over time. The voice is endlessly fascinating to me. How it works. Why it works. What happens when everything aligns and a singer or speaker finds that moment of freedom and flow.</p>
      
      <p>That fascination has taken me down many paths. I spent nearly 30 years conducting choirs in public schools. I was an elementary school teacher for five years — and yes, I taught my students music too, because that's just who I am. I've been teaching voice privately for decades, first alongside my school career, then in my first dedicated studio in Puyallup (2014–2018), and now at Ted's Voice Academy in Lacey, which I opened in 2023. Along the way, my path has been shaped by dozens and dozens of wonderful voice teachers, choral directors, music educators, and vocal and performance coaches — each a valuable influence in developing my own love and understanding of the voice and how to guide it.</p>
      
      <p>As a performer, I've competed and won awards in multiple voice classifications — tenor, baritone, and bass. That range of experience taught me something I come back to often: good singing is good singing — the rest is just notes.</p>
      
      <p>Through all of it, one thing has stayed constant: my passion for helping people communicate from a place of self-alignment and self-understanding. When that happens — when someone finds their authentic voice — they experience a sense of freedom, joy, and fulfillment that changes everything. That's what I live for.</p>

      <h2>What I believe about voice</h2>
      
      <div class="beliefs-grid">
        <div class="belief-card">
          <h3>Expression comes first</h3>
          <p>Technique exists to serve expression — to give you the freedom to say what you mean, the way you mean it.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="belief-card">
          <h3>Every voice is unique</h3>
          <p>You are better at being you than anyone else will ever be — and you can never be as good at being like someone else as you can at being you. My job isn't to make you sound like someone else. It's to help you sound more like yourself — with more ease, more power, and more confidence.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="belief-card">
          <h3>Understanding the "why" and the "how"</h3>
          <p>When you know how your voice works, you can keep growing on your own. You're not dependent on me to fix things. You have the knowledge to figure it out yourself.</p>

        <div class="belief-card">

      <h2>Background</h2>
      
      <p>I hold two degrees from Seattle Pacific University — one in Vocal Performance, one in K-12 Music Education. I earned National Board Certification in 2005 and hold a lifetime teaching certification in Washington State.</p>
      
      <p>In 2025, I was recognized among Washington's top vocal instructors (BusinessRate) and named Entrepreneur of the Year by the Lacey South Sound Chamber of Commerce. These recognitions mean something to me — not as trophies, but as confirmation that the work matters.</p>
      
      <p class="credentials-intro">Beyond individual coaching, I've developed frameworks and expertise that represent my broader approach to voice mastery:</p>
      
      <div class="framework-cards">
        <div class="framework-card avf-card">
          <h3>The Adaptive Voice Framework (AVF)</h3>
          <p>A comprehensive approach to understanding how voices work. I published the full framework in 2025 as a nearly 700-page book, now available on Amazon. It represents decades of learning distilled into a system any singer or speaker can use.</p>

        </div>
        
        <div class="framework-card pass-card">
          <h3>The PASS Profile</h3>
          <p>A professional communication assessment that reveals your unique "communication fingerprint" — your natural patterns, tendencies, and preferences in how you communicate. Unlike personality tests that sort people into a handful of types, PASS measures actual communication behaviors across 40 distinct traits. The mathematics behind the assessment generate virtually unlimited unique combinations — ensuring every report reflects a genuinely individual pattern, not a category you've been sorted into. I designed it to help people understand how they communicate — so they can leverage their strengths intentionally and grow with purpose.</p>

        <div class="framework-card health-card">
          <h3>Vocal Health Guidance</h3>
          <p>I've spent years developing my understanding of vocal health — how voices tire, strain, recover, and stay resilient. I'm not a medical professional or speech-language pathologist, but I work alongside them readily. They handle diagnosis and therapy; I help with the technique and habits that keep voices healthy. Clients come to me for vocal conditioning, recovery support, and practical strategies they can use every day. It's a natural extension of my teaching — because a voice that's well cared for is a voice that can grow.</p>

      <h2>A bit more about me</h2>
      
      <p>I live in Lacey, Washington, where I teach from my home studio. I'm madly in love with my wife, Tammy — she's at the center of everything good in my life. And if you come to my studio, you'll be greeted by Keeva, our dog, who considers welcoming clients one of her most important jobs.</p>
      
      <p>When I'm not working with students, I'm probably practicing, reading about voice science, or finding new ways to explain concepts I've been teaching for decades. The voice still fascinates me. I don't think that will ever change.</p>
      
      <p>If you're curious about working together, I'd love to hear from you.</p>
