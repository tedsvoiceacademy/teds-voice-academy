      <p class="page-date">Last updated: <time datetime="2026-02-05">February 5, 2026</time></p>
      <p class="intro-text">
        I've been singing since I was eight years old. I started teaching in 1988. In the decades since, I've worked with thousands of singers and speakers — in classrooms, rehearsal halls, private studios, and on stages around the country.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-text">
        What keeps me going? I believe authentic connection is the foundation of human experience. When we communicate from a place of truth, we inspire trust, foster understanding, and create relationships that matter.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-text">
        I do this work because I believe your authentic voice is your most powerful asset. My purpose is to help you uncover and embrace your true voice — whether through singing, speaking, or professional communication — so you can express yourself confidently, connect deeply with others, and lead with impact.

  <!-- My Path Section -->
  <section class="path-section">
    <div class="container container-narrow reveal">
      <h2>How I got here</h2>
      
      <p>I fell in love with the voice early — and that love has only deepened over time. The voice is endlessly fascinating to me. How it works. Why it works. What happens when everything aligns and a singer or speaker finds that moment of freedom and flow.</p>
      
      <p>That fascination has taken me down many paths. I spent nearly 30 years conducting choirs in public schools. I was an elementary school teacher for five years — and yes, I taught my students music too, because that's just who I am. I've been teaching voice privately for decades, first alongside my school career, then in my first dedicated studio in Puyallup (2014–2018), and now at Ted's Voice Academy in Lacey, which I opened in 2023. Along the way, my path has been shaped by dozens and dozens of wonderful voice teachers, choral directors, music educators, and vocal and performance coaches — each a valuable influence in developing my own love and understanding of the voice and how to guide it.</p>
      
      <p>As a performer, I've competed and won awards in multiple voice classifications — tenor, baritone, and bass. That range of experience taught me something I come back to often: good singing is good singing — the rest is just notes.</p>

      <blockquote class="pull-quote">When someone finds their authentic voice — they experience a sense of freedom, joy, and fulfillment that changes everything.</blockquote>

      <p>Through all of it, one thing has stayed constant: my passion for helping people communicate from a place of self-alignment and self-understanding. When that happens — when someone finds their authentic voice — they experience a sense of freedom, joy, and fulfillment that changes everything. That's what I live for.</p>

      <p>I hold two degrees from Seattle Pacific University — one in Vocal Performance, one in K-12 Music Education. I earned National Board Certification in 2005 and hold a lifetime teaching certification in Washington State.</p>
      
      <p>In 2025, I was recognized among Washington's top vocal instructors (BusinessRate) and named Entrepreneur of the Year by the Lacey South Sound Chamber of Commerce. These recognitions mean something to me — not as trophies, but as confirmation that the work matters.</p>

          <h3>The Adaptive Voice Framework™ (AVF™)</h3>
          <p>A comprehensive approach to understanding how voices work. I published the full framework in 2025 as a nearly 700-page book, now available on Amazon. It represents decades of learning distilled into a system any singer or speaker can use.</p>

          <h3>The PASS Profile™</h3>
          <p>A professional communication assessment that reveals your unique "communication fingerprint" — your natural patterns, tendencies, and preferences in how you communicate. Unlike personality tests that sort people into a handful of types, PASS measures actual communication behaviors across 40 distinct traits. The mathematics behind the assessment generate virtually unlimited unique combinations — ensuring every report reflects a genuinely individual pattern, not a category you've been sorted into. I designed it to help people understand how they communicate — so they can leverage their strengths intentionally and grow with purpose.</p>

          <h3>Vocal Health Guidance</h3>
          <p>I've spent years developing my understanding of vocal health — how voices tire, strain, recover, and stay resilient. I'm not a medical professional or speech-language pathologist, but I work alongside them readily. They handle diagnosis and therapy; I help with the technique and habits that keep voices healthy. Clients come to me for vocal conditioning, recovery support, and practical strategies they can use every day. It's a natural extension of my teaching — because a voice that's well cared for is a voice that can grow.</p>

And if you come to my studio, you'll be greeted by Keeva, our dog, who considers welcoming clients one of her most important jobs.</p>
      
      <p>When I'm not working with students, I'm probably practicing, reading about voice science, or finding new ways to explain concepts I've been teaching for decades. The voice still fascinates me. I don't think that will ever change.</p>
