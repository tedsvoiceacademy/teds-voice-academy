  <!-- What It Measures -->
  <section class="measures">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>What PASS Profile Measures</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">PASS Profile examines your communication patterns across six domains:</p>
      
      <div class="domains-grid">
        <div class="domain-card">
          <h3>Communication Purpose</h3>
          <p>What drives you when you communicate. Are you drawn to building relationships or achieving outcomes? Understanding others or influencing them?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="domain-card">
          <h3>Thinking Style</h3>
          <p>How you process and share ideas. Big-picture or detail-oriented? Linear or flexible? Analytical or intuitive?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="domain-card">
          <h3>Relational Approach</h3>
          <p>How you navigate human dynamics. Direct or diplomatic? Task-focused or people-focused?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="domain-card">
          <h3>Temporal & Decisional Orientation</h3>
          <p>Your relationship with time and decisions. Future-focused or present-focused? Deliberate or quick?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="domain-card">
          <h3>Social Positioning</h3>
          <p>Your natural role in groups. Leading or supporting? Visible or behind-the-scenes? Collaborative or independent?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="domain-card">
          <h3>Adaptability</h3>
          <p>How consistently or flexibly you communicate across situations.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <p class="section-closing">Within these six domains, PASS measures 40 specific traits. Together, they create your unique communication fingerprint.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- Understanding Your Scores -->
  <section class="scores">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Understanding Your Scores</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">Each of your 40 traits is measured on a scale from 0 to 100. These scores represent where you naturally fall on a continuum of communication tendencies.</p>
      
      <div class="score-ranges">
        <div class="score-range high">
          <div class="score-label">70-100</div>
          <div class="score-description">
            <strong>Higher scores</strong> indicate natural strengths — patterns that come easily and typically energize you.

        </div>
        <div class="score-range mid">
          <div class="score-label">40-69</div>
          <div class="score-description">
            <strong>Mid-range scores</strong> show flexibility — you adapt your approach based on context and situation. This versatility is itself a strength.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="score-range low">
          <div class="score-label">0-39</div>
          <div class="score-description">
            <strong>Lower scores</strong> reveal distinctive features of your style. Every pattern has contexts where it excels. Your valleys help define what makes your fingerprint unique.
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="key-insight">
        <p><strong>Here's what matters most: your valleys are as important as your peaks.</strong> Someone with high Empathy and low Directness is defined by both scores together. The combination creates your unique communication fingerprint.</p>
        <p>Your report analyzes all 40 trait scores together — how they combine and interact is what makes your pattern genuinely yours.</p>

  <!-- How It's Different -->

      <h2>How PASS Profile Is Different</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">You may have taken assessments like DISC, Myers-Briggs, or CliftonStrengths. They measure broad personality traits and sort you into types. PASS Profile offers something different.</p>
      
      <div class="differentiators">
        <div class="diff-item">
          <h3>Communication-specific</h3>
          <p>PASS focuses on how you communicate and interact in professional settings — the behaviors that shape your daily work relationships and effectiveness.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="diff-item">
          <h3>Scenario-based</h3>
          <p>PASS presents real workplace situations and asks what you actually do. This captures your authentic patterns in action.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="diff-item">
          <h3>Truly individual</h3>
          <p>Most assessments sort you into one of 4, 16, or 34 types. PASS generates more unique combinations than atoms in the observable universe — making it virtually impossible for two people to share the same exact profile.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="diff-item">
          <h3>100% asset-based</h3>
          <p>Every trait represents a strength in certain contexts. Your unique pattern shows where you naturally excel and how to leverage your tendencies with intention.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>How I Use PASS Profile in Coaching</h2>
      <p>PASS Profile started as a tool I developed for my speaking clients. When someone comes to me wanting to communicate with more clarity, confidence, or presence, understanding their natural communication patterns gives us a powerful starting point.</p>
      <p>The assessment reveals what they're already doing well — so we can build on it. It shows where their style naturally excels — so they can seek out those situations. And it highlights opportunities to expand their range when certain contexts call for a different approach.</p>
      <p>For professionals working on communication presence and impact, the assessment is often transformative. For clients focused on vocal technique, projection, or accent work, we may take a different path. Every client's needs are unique.</p>

      <h2>Common Questions About PASS Profile</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How is PASS Profile different from DISC or Myers-Briggs?</h3>
        <p>DISC and Myers-Briggs measure broad personality traits and sort you into types. PASS Profile focuses specifically on communication behavior in professional settings. It uses real workplace scenarios instead of abstract questions, and it generates truly individual results — more unique combinations than atoms in the observable universe.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How long does the assessment take?</h3>
        <p>Most people complete it in 30 to 60 minutes. You can save your progress and return later — each scenario has a Save and Exit button.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Will my results match someone else's?</h3>
        <p>It's virtually impossible. PASS measures 40 traits on a continuous scale, creating more unique combinations than atoms in the observable universe. Your communication fingerprint is genuinely yours.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can teams take PASS Profile together?</h3>
        <p>Yes. When team members understand each other's communication patterns, they collaborate more effectively. Each person takes the assessment individually and receives their own report. Team workshops and organizational applications are in development.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What do I do with my results after I get them?</h3>
        <p>Your report includes a 90-day development roadmap, a shareable "Working With Others" section for colleagues, and a one-page Quick Reference Card. You can also book a coaching session to explore your results in depth and apply them to specific professional challenges.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How much does PASS Profile cost?</h3>
        <p>The assessment is $49.99. You receive a comprehensive 46-48 page personalized PDF report, typically delivered within minutes of completion.</p>
