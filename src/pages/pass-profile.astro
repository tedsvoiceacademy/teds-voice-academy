      <p>PASS Profile started as a tool I developed for my speaking clients. When someone comes to me wanting to communicate with more clarity, confidence, or presence, understanding their natural communication patterns gives us a powerful starting point.</p>
      <p>The assessment reveals what they're already doing well — so we can build on it. It shows where their style naturally excels — so they can seek out those situations. And it highlights opportunities to expand their range when certain contexts call for a different approach.</p>
      <p>For professionals working on communication presence and impact, the assessment is often transformative. For clients focused on <a href="/avf/">vocal technique</a>, projection, or accent work, we may take a different path. Every client's needs are unique. <a href="/about/">Learn more about my background</a> and how I bring PASS into <a href="/workshops/">team workshops</a>.</p>

  <!-- PASS FAQ Section -->
  <section class="pass-faq">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="reveal">Common Questions About PASS Profile™</h2>

      <details class="faq-item reveal">
        <summary>How is PASS Profile different from DISC or Myers-Briggs?</summary>
        <p>DISC, Myers-Briggs, and CliftonStrengths measure broad personality traits and sort you into types — one of 4, 16, or 34 categories. PASS Profile focuses specifically on communication behaviors in professional settings. It presents 60 real workplace scenarios (not abstract self-descriptions) and measures 40 traits on a continuous 0-100 scale. The result is more unique combinations than atoms in the observable universe — your profile is mathematically yours alone.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item reveal">
        <summary>Is PASS Profile a personality test?</summary>
        <p>No. PASS measures communication behaviors — how you actually communicate and interact in professional settings. It doesn't measure personality, intelligence, competence, or character. It's a professional development tool for self-awareness and intentional communication, not a psychological or clinical assessment.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item reveal">
        <summary>How does the assessment work?</summary>
        <p>You'll encounter 60 workplace scenarios presenting realistic professional situations. For each scenario, you rate four possible responses on a 1-5 scale based on how much each sounds like you. This produces 240 individual data points. Each response contributes to multiple traits simultaneously — there are no right or wrong answers. Your progress auto-saves on every response, and you can pause and resume anytime.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item reveal">
        <summary>How long does the assessment take?</summary>
        <p>Most people complete it in 30 to 60 minutes. There's no time limit — go at your own pace. Your progress auto-saves on every response, and the "Save and Exit" button lets you stop anytime and return later to pick up exactly where you left off.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item reveal">
        <summary>Will my results match someone else's?</summary>
        <p>It's virtually impossible. PASS measures 40 traits on a continuous 0-100 scale, creating more unique combinations than atoms in the observable universe (10<sup>168</sup> possible profiles). Unlike assessments that sort you into one of a handful of types, your communication fingerprint is mathematically unique to you.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item reveal">
        <summary>What do the scores mean?</summary>
        <p>Each trait is scored 0-100 and falls into one of three ranges: <strong>Natural (66-100)</strong> means this behavior comes easily — it's your default. <strong>Flexible (36-65)</strong> means you adapt based on context — this versatility is itself a strength. <strong>Intentional (0-35)</strong> means you can absolutely do this — it just takes conscious effort. All three ranges are equally valuable. Your report analyzes how all 40 scores work together — the pattern is what makes you unique.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item reveal">
        <summary>Can I use this for hiring or screening?</summary>
        <p>No. PASS Profile is explicitly a professional development tool. It is not designed or validated for hiring, screening, or selection decisions. It measures communication preferences — not competence, ability, or job performance. It's designed to help individuals and teams understand and leverage their communication patterns, not to evaluate or rank people.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item reveal">
        <summary>Can I share my results with my team?</summary>
        <p>Yes — your report includes a "Working With Others" section specifically designed to be shared with colleagues. It's written in first person ("I communicate best when..." / "To work effectively with me...") so teammates can quickly understand how to collaborate with you. It's also available as a one-click copy from your client portal.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item reveal">
        <summary>Can teams use PASS Profile together?</summary>
        <p>Yes. Each team member takes the individual PASS assessment first. Then the Team Dynamics Alignment report analyzes how everyone's communication patterns interact — revealing pair dynamics, six communication roles (Initiator, Bridge, Anchor, Catalyst, Harmonizer, and Strategist), collective strengths, and team-specific scenarios. TDA is available for teams of 2-12 people, priced from $39.99 to $119.99 by team size.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item reveal">
        <summary>What is Voice-Brand Alignment?</summary>
        <p>Voice-Brand Alignment is the "what does this mean for MY job?" layer on top of your PASS Profile. You provide your job title, industry, key audiences, and role description. The system then generates an 8-10 page report showing exactly how to deploy your communication fingerprint in your specific role — including a personal communication brand statement, role-specific strategic playbook, and a 90-day integration plan. Available in the PASS + Voice-Brand Bundle for $59.99.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item reveal">
        <summary>What is Team Dynamics Alignment?</summary>
        <p>Team Dynamics Alignment analyzes how a team's individual communication patterns interact. It reveals pair dynamics (how every pair of members communicates), communication roles (Initiator, Bridge, Anchor, Catalyst, Harmonizer, and Strategist), collective strengths, and team-specific scenarios with actionable strategies. Reports include SVG visualizations like trait heatmaps and domain radar overlays. Available for teams of 2-3 ($39.99), 4-8 ($79.99), or 9-12 ($119.99).</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item reveal">
        <summary>What do I do with my results after I get them?</summary>
        <p>Your report includes a 90-day development roadmap with specific daily practices, a shareable "Working With Others" section for colleagues, a one-page Quick Reference Card for daily use, and a Similar Well-Known Communicator match. You can also book a one-on-one coaching session (in person or virtually) to explore your results in depth and apply them to specific professional challenges.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item reveal">
        <summary>How much does PASS Profile cost?</summary>
        <p>PASS Profile is $49.99. The PASS + Voice-Brand Bundle is $59.99 (saves $10 vs. purchasing separately). Team Dynamics Alignment is $39.99 for 2-3 members, $79.99 for 4-8, or $119.99 for 9-12. All reports are personalized PDFs delivered to your email within minutes of completion.</p>
