  <!-- Origin Story Section -->
  <section class="story-section">
    <div class="container container-narrow reveal">
      <h2 class="decorated-heading">I've been directing since the 1980s. I tried everything.</h2>
      <p class="drop-cap">If you're a chorus director, you know the drill. You've got a show coming up, singers have moved around, new members joined, and you need to figure out who stands where on those risers. Again.</p>
      <p>I spent decades looking for a good way to handle this. <strong>Seating chart tools?</strong> Made for classrooms, not risers. <strong>PowerPoint?</strong> Life is too short to drag little text boxes around slides. <strong>Cookie sheets with magnets?</strong> Worked okay — until someone bumped the table.</p>
      <p><strong>Sticky notes on poster board?</strong> The sticky wore off, coffee spilled, notes stuck to someone's sleeve, and the giant board took up half my office. <strong>Velcro names on foam board?</strong> Took forever to set up, and moving people was still more hassle than it was worth.</p>
      <blockquote class="pull-quote">After years of settling, I finally said: it's time to build my own.</blockquote>
      <p>I designed Riser Chart for the way I actually work — drag a singer onto a spot, see voice parts at a glance, try a different arrangement in seconds, print a clean chart for the risers. No learning curve. No monthly fees eating away at your chorus budget.</p>
