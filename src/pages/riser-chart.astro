          <h2 class="decorated-heading decorated-heading--left">I've been directing since the 1980s. I tried everything.</h2>
          <p class="drop-cap">If you're a chorus director, you know the drill. You've got a show coming up, singers have moved around, new members joined, and you need to figure out who stands where on those risers. Again.</p>
          <p>I spent decades looking for a good way to handle this. <strong>Seating chart tools?</strong> Made for classrooms, not risers. <strong>PowerPoint?</strong> Life is too short to drag little text boxes around slides. <strong>Cookie sheets with magnets?</strong> Worked okay — until someone bumped the table.</p>
          <p><strong>Sticky notes on poster board?</strong> The sticky wore off, coffee spilled, notes stuck to someone's sleeve, and the giant board took up half my office. <strong>Velcro names on foam board?</strong> Took forever to set up, and moving people was still more hassle than it was worth.</p>
          <blockquote class="pull-quote">After years of settling, I finally said: it's time to build my own.</blockquote>
          <p>I designed Riser Chart for the way I actually work — drag a singer onto a spot, see voice parts at a glance, try a different arrangement in seconds, print a clean chart for the risers. No learning curve. No monthly fees eating away at your chorus budget.</p>

    <div class="container container-narrow">
      <h2 class="decorated-heading reveal">Common Questions</h2>

      <details class="faq-item reveal">
        <summary>How do I access Riser Chart?</summary>
        <p>Riser Chart is a hosted web app — just open it in your browser at riser.tedsvoiceacademy.com. No software to install, no files to manage. After purchase, you receive an access code by email and activate with your email address. Use the same code on any device.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item reveal">
        <summary>What voice part systems does it support?</summary>
        <p>Any voice part system you use. Define up to 24 custom voice parts with custom names and colors. Works for barbershop (Tenor, Lead, Baritone, Bass), SATB, show choir, a cappella — any ensemble structure. Sub-parts like Soprano 1 and Soprano 2 are supported.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item reveal">
        <summary>Is my data stored in the cloud?</summary>
        <p>By default, all your chorus data — singers, formations, photos, branding — is stored locally on your device. If you enable the optional Cloud Sync feature (found in the Display menu), a copy is also stored securely in the cloud so you can keep multiple devices in sync. Cloud Sync is off by default.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item reveal">
        <summary>Do I have to pay monthly?</summary>
        <p>No. Riser Chart is a one-time purchase of $99. No subscription, no recurring fees. All upgrades come automatically — every time you open the app, you're on the latest version.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item reveal">
        <summary>Can I use it on multiple devices?</summary>
        <p>Yes. Activate with the same email and access code on each device. Enable Cloud Sync in the Display menu to automatically keep your data in sync across devices.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item reveal">
        <summary>What if I don't want to use Cloud Sync?</summary>
        <p>No problem — Cloud Sync is off by default. You can transfer data manually using Export > Backup JSON on one device and Export > Restore JSON on the other.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item reveal">
        <summary>How many singers can it handle?</summary>
        <p>Riser Chart has been tested with 200+ singers and handles large ensembles smoothly. You can have unlimited formations, each with its own riser configuration and placements.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item reveal">
        <summary>Does it work on my phone or tablet?</summary>
        <p>Riser Chart is designed for desktop and laptop computers. The drag-and-drop interface works best with a mouse or trackpad. While it may display on tablets, the full experience requires a desktop browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge).</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item reveal">
        <summary>Can I import my roster from a spreadsheet?</summary>
        <p>Yes. Export your roster from Excel or Google Sheets as a CSV file, then use Roster > Import CSV. Download the CSV Template for the correct column format. Voice parts, groups, timbre ratings, height, and notes are all supported. Groups are auto-created if they don't already exist.</p>
