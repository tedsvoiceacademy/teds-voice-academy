    <div class="container">
      <p class="answer-capsule">Intonation Lab is a browser-based ear training tool for singers, created by Ted Chamberlain. It uses real-time pitch detection to help singers develop precise intonation using just intonation — the pure tuning system based on natural harmonic ratios. Features include 13 intervals, 7 chord types, 13 timbres, a beat frequency visualization, cymatics display, pitch tracker, and a 52-exercise guided curriculum. Pricing starts at $99 for individuals, with group licenses up to $999 for choruses.</p>

  <!-- The Problem Section -->
  <section class="problem-section">
    <div class="container container-narrow reveal">
      <h2 class="decorated-heading">Pianos are out of tune. On purpose.</h2>
      <p class="drop-cap">Every piano in the world uses equal temperament — a tuning system that slightly detunes every interval so all 12 keys sound equally acceptable. It's a practical compromise, and for keyboards it works well enough.</p>
      <p>But singers aren't keyboards. When you sing a major third that matches a piano, you're actually 14 cents sharp of the pure, resonant interval. When a <a href="/ensembles">barbershop quartet or choir</a> locks into a chord that rings with an almost physical buzz, they're singing in just intonation — pure ratios that equal temperament can only approximate.</p>
      <blockquote class="pull-quote">When a chord locks in, you can feel it. That's just intonation.</blockquote>
      <p>The challenge is training your ear to hear and produce these pure intervals reliably. That's what Intonation Lab is built to do.</p>

      <details class="faq-item reveal">
        <summary>What is just intonation and why does it matter for singers?</summary>
        <p>Just intonation is a tuning system based on pure harmonic ratios — the natural relationships between frequencies. When singers tune to these pure ratios rather than piano tuning (equal temperament), chords ring with clarity and resonance. It's the difference between a chord that sounds good and one that locks in with a physical buzz you can feel.</p>
