The performing arts scene in Thurston County is thriving. Whether you are a shower singer looking for community, a teen wanting to sharpen your skills, or a seasoned performer ready for the stage, Olympia and Lacey have a "home" for your voice. As a vocal coach, the most common question I get isn't "How do I sing high notes?"—it's "Where can I sing?" Below is a curated guide to the best local choral and theater organizations auditioning for their 2025/2026 seasons, along with my top tips for nailing your audition.

## Local Choirs & Vocal Groups

### Voices of the Sound

**The Vibe:** Energetic, close-harmony A Cappella. This is a mixed barbershop chorus that emphasizes unity, artistry, and the pure joy of ringing chords.

**Who it's for:** Men and women (all voice parts) who want to improve their ear and sing in a supportive, fun environment.

**Audition Insight:** As the director of this group, I can tell you we look for "coachability" just as much as vocal skill. We love guests—come visit a rehearsal to see if we're the right fit!

### Olympia Chorus (Sweet Adelines)

**The Vibe:** A powerhouse chorus with a rich history in the Sweet Adelines International tradition. They are known for their vibrant performances and tight harmonies.

**Who it's for:** Treble voices (women) looking for camaraderie, education, and performance opportunities.

**Audition Insight:** They have a wonderful process for new members that often involves visiting rehearsals first. You don't need to be a pro sight-reader, but a good ear for harmony is a huge plus.

### Masterworks Choral Ensemble

**The Vibe:** Classical, polished, and grand. Masterworks is a staple of the Olympia arts community, often performing with orchestral accompaniment at the Washington Center.

**Who it's for:** Singers with choral experience who enjoy tackling major works and diverse repertoire.

**Audition Insight:** Auditions usually happen in January and August. Be prepared to sight-read and prepare a piece that showcases your vocal range.

## Community & Professional Theater

### Olympia Little Theatre (OLT)

**The Season:** As one of the oldest community theaters in the area, OLT offers a robust season of plays ranging from comedy to drama.

**Audition Style:** Often involves "cold readings" from the script rather than prepared monologues.

**Why audition?** It's a low-pressure, high-reward environment perfect for getting back on stage.

### Olympia Family Theater (OFT)

**The Season:** Known for heartwarming and whimsical productions like The Snow Queen or The Hobbit.

**Audition Style:** Inclusive and welcoming. They often look for actors who can move well and bring big character energy.

**Why audition?** A fantastic place to volunteer and work with a team that values community impact.

### Harlequin Productions

**The Season:** Olympia's professional theater company. They produce high-quality plays and musicals year-round at the State Theater.

**Audition Style:** Professional standard. You will typically need a headshot, resume, and two contrasting monologues (or a song cut for musicals).

**Note:** Keep an eye on their site for general season auditions or specific show submissions.

## Youth Opportunities

### Olympia Youth Chorus

**Overview:** An incredible organization for young singers to learn proper vocal technique and music literacy in a choir setting. They have ensembles for various ages and skill levels.

## 3 Tips to Nail Your Olympia Audition

### 1. Know the "Room"

If you are auditioning for a microphone-based pop musical, don't sing a classical aria. If you are auditioning for an unamplified choir, don't sing in a breathy "whisper pop" style. Research the group before you go!

### 2. Confidence > Perfection

Directors in Olympia (myself included!) are always rooting for you. We would rather see a confident singer make a small mistake and keep going than a terrified singer stop in the middle. Walk in like you're happy to be there. Think "Disney" energy!

### 3. Warm Up Before You Arrive

Nerves constrict your throat. A solid 15-minute warm-up (minimum) ensures you have access to your full range the moment you step into the audition room.

## Need Help Prepping?

Whether you need to pick the perfect 16-bar cut for a musical or want to polish your sight-reading for a choir audition, I can help you walk into that room with confidence.
