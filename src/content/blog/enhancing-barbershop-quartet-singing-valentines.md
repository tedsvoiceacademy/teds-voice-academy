In the vibrant world of American vocal music, barbershop quartets hold a special place, known for their harmonious and charismatic performances. This is particularly true for the Seattle Seachordsmen Barbershop Harmony Chorus as they prepare for their annual Singing Valentines event. As an experienced vocal coach working with these talented groups, I have seen first-hand how targeted coaching can significantly improve their performances. This blog post explores the importance of vocal coaching in preparing for Singing Valentines.

## The Essence of Singing Valentines

Singing Valentines is a tradition embraced by various barbershop choruses. During this event, a quartet surprises someone with a heartfelt serenade, a Valentine's Day card, and a rose, often in a public setting. This not only spreads joy but also highlights the unique appeal of barbershop harmony.

## The Role of a Vocal Coach in Preparing Quartets

My role as a vocal coach was to refine the skills of different quartets. This included "under glass" coaching, where singers learn from their peers in a dynamic environment. Our focus areas included vocal production, ensemble skills, and performance presentation.

### Vocal Production

Barbershop music requires a blend of accuracy and expressiveness. Our coaching sessions focused on enhancing vocal strength and control, ensuring that each singer's voice was clear and well-modulated.

### Ensemble Skills

The essence of a quartet's charm lies in its cohesive sound. We focused on perfecting harmonization, ensuring a balanced blend of voices and the distinct barbershop sound.

### Performance and Expression

The emotional delivery of a Singing Valentine is crucial. We worked on improving stage presence, including gestures and facial expressions, to effectively convey the song's emotions.

## Results and Impact

The progress made by the singers was astounding. In a short period, the quartets refined their performances, showcasing a level of professionalism and charm. This demonstrates the significant role of vocal coaching in enhancing musical quality and building performer confidence, ensuring a memorable experience for both the quartets and the recipients.

## Conclusion

As the Seattle Seachordsmen prepare for the Singing Valentines, the benefits of vocal coaching are clear. It's not just about skill enhancement; it's about crafting an unforgettable performance for the singers and their audience. For barbershop quartets striving for excellence, working with a skilled vocal coach is a step towards realizing their musical potential.

If you're part of a barbershop quartet or chorus, consider how a vocal coach can enhance your group's performance, especially for special events like Singing Valentines.

AND... If you've never had the pleasure of arranging a Singing Valentine from a quartet in your local barbershop chorus, I highly encourage you to give it a try. It's an incredibly touching and memorable way to express your affection. The harmony and charm of a barbershop quartet add a special layer of warmth to your message of love, making it an unforgettable experience for both the giver and the receiver. Trust me, it's a wonderful and unique way to say "I love you."
