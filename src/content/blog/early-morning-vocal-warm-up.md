Welcome to your comprehensive guide for an effective early morning vocal warm-up designed specifically to clear the throat and prepare your voice for the day. I recall reading about this exercise in a magazine years ago, and I have used it frequently since. Let's dive into a routine that will help singers achieve a clear and healthy voice through precise and tailored exercises.

## 1. Establishing Your Posture

Good posture is the foundation of effective singing. Begin by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, ensuring your knees are slightly bent and not locked. Imagine a string pulling your head towards the ceiling, elongating your spine while keeping it straight. Your shoulders should be relaxed and down, with your chest open but not strained. This posture allows for optimal breathing and vocal production.

## 2. Box Breathing Technique

Before we begin vocalizing, let's focus on our breathing with the box breathing technique. This method involves four equal parts:

- **Inhale** for four counts, deeply filling your lungs.
- **Hold** your breath for four counts, allowing your body to absorb the oxygen.
- **Exhale** for eight counts, releasing the air slowly and controlled, which helps in relaxing your vocal cords and clearing any residual tension.
- **Hold** again for four counts before starting the next cycle.

This breathing exercise, repeated five times, is essential for calming the mind and body, preparing your vocal cords for the exercises ahead.

## 3. Gentle Humming

Gently hum across your vocal range to assess where your voice stands. Focus on smooth, sustained vibrations, particularly in areas that feel less warmed or slightly congested. Humming not only warms up the vocal cords but also begins the process of loosening any mucus.

## 4. The 'Hummuh' Sequence: Detailed Explanation

For the 'Hummuh' sequence, follow these steps carefully:

1. Sing "Hummuh" five times on a comfortable mid-range pitch.
2. Then, perform a quick inhale, breaking it into three segmented parts to take one complete breath.
3. Repeat "Hummuh" five more times, followed by another segmented three-part inhale.
4. Complete this pattern a third time (5 "Hummuh"s and a segmented inhale).

This constitutes one full repetition. After completing this, move up a half step in pitch and repeat the entire sequence. Aim to do this for 8-10 total repetitions.

The initial "h" sound acts as a gentle mechanic to help clear the throat, with the segmented breathing aiding in vocal control and stamina.

## 5. The 'Yung-Yung-Yung' Exercise

This exercise starts on the key of D, using the 5-3-1 pattern (sol-mi-do) on "Yung":

- Perform this pattern, then ascend by half steps for five additional repetitions, reaching the key of G at the highest point.
- After reaching the top, descend back down by half steps to end on the original key of D.

This exercise not only aids in clearing the throat but also in fine-tuning your vocal agility and blending the registers, with a focus on maintaining a light and resonant tone.

## 6. Concluding with Gentle Humming

After completing the 'Yung-Yung-Yung' exercise, return to gentle humming to reassess your vocal condition. This final step is crucial for ensuring your voice is fully warmed up and clear. If necessary, repeat the sequence or parts of it to address any areas that need further warming or clearing.

## Final Thoughts

This morning vocal warm-up routine is designed to methodically clear your throat and warm up your voice, ensuring you start your day with vocal clarity and health. Remember, the key to an effective warm-up is patience and attentiveness to your body's needs. Adjust the exercises as necessary to suit your unique voice, and embrace the day with confidence in your vocal abilities.
