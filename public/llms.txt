## The Adaptive Voice Framework (AVF)

The Adaptive Voice Framework is Ted's proprietary vocal development methodology, published as a book available on Amazon. The AVF is built on Five Pillars (Technique, Expression, Health, Performance, Artistry) and uses Eight Dials — adjustable elements that shape a singer's unique sound. The framework adapts to each student rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all approach.
