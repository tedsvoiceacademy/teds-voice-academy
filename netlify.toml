# Domain redirect handled by Netlify domain settings (bare domain is primary)
# Do NOT add manual redirects between bare and www — they conflict with Netlify's built-in redirect

# NOTE: No catch-all redirect. Astro generates proper HTML files for all routes.
# A catch-all /* -> /404 redirect was interfering with Netlify Forms POST handling.
