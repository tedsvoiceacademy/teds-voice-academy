# Forward Light Voice
## Style Guide for Written Projects

---

## Core Spirit

This voice believes in the reader. It offers guidance with warmth and clarity. It speaks directly, uses simple language, and trusts that encouragement works better than correction. Every sentence aims to help.

The reader should feel respected, capable, and supported. They should never feel talked down to, hyped up, or handled.

## Tone Characteristics

### Encouraging
Acknowledge effort. Celebrate progress. Speak to what's possible. Let optimism come through in how you frame things, even when the topic is difficult.

### Grounded
Stay concrete. Use real examples. Avoid promises that sound too big. If something is hard, say it's hard. Honesty builds trust.

### Kind
Assume good intent. Speak generously. Remember that the person reading may be tired, uncertain, or trying something new.

### Direct
Say what you mean. Get to the point. Respect the reader's time. Clarity is a form of kindness.

### Genuine
Write like you're talking to someone you respect. Avoid polish that sounds like performance. If a sentence feels like it belongs in an ad, rewrite it.

## Framing Principles

### Lead with what something IS
State the positive directly. Trust it to stand on its own.

**Write:** "This approach helps you build momentum."

**Avoid:** "This isn't about perfectionÃ¢â‚¬â€it's about progress."

### Trust the reader
You don't need to preempt objections or defend your point. Say what's true and move forward.

### Let encouragement be specific
Vague praise feels hollow. Specific encouragement feels real.

**Write:** "You've already done the hardest part by starting."

**Avoid:** "You've got this!"

### Stay in forward motion
Keep the energy moving toward action, understanding, or possibility. Avoid circling back to explain what you don't mean.

## Sentence-Level Guidance

### Reading level
Aim for 8th grade comprehension. Use familiar words. Keep sentences short enough to follow easily. One idea per sentence works well.

### Rhythm
Vary sentence length for natural flow. A few short sentences in a row can build momentum. A longer one can slow things down when you need the reader to absorb something.

### Word choice
Choose plain words. "Help" over "facilitate." "Show" over "demonstrate." "Start" over "initiate."

Avoid jargon unless your audience uses it daily. Even then, ask whether a simpler word would work just as well.

### Punctuation
Periods over commas when possible. If a sentence has more than one comma, consider splitting it.

## What This Voice Sounds Like

- A trusted mentor sharing something useful
- A smart friend explaining something clearly
- Someone who knows the material and wants you to succeed
- Warm, steady, real

---

## Context Adjustments

### Marketing materials
Keep claims honest and specific. Let the value speak for itself. Enthusiasm is fine; hype is not.

### Instructional materials
Prioritize clarity. Walk the reader through each step. Assume they're capable and just need good information.

### Finance documents
Stay plain and precise. Numbers speak clearly when the words around them are simple. Avoid softening language that obscures meaning.
