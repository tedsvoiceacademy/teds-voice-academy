# TED'S VOICE ACADEMY â€” BLOG WRITING STYLE GUIDE
## Addendum to Forward Light Voice | v2

---

## Purpose

This guide ensures consistency across all blog content for Ted's Voice Academy. It builds on the Forward Light foundation while adding specific guidance for educational blog posts that serve both readers and search visibility.

---

## Non-Negotiable Principles

These carry over directly from Forward Light and apply to every blog post without exception:

### 1. Accessible Reading Level
Write at an 8th grade comprehension level, even when the topic is sophisticated. Complex ideas can be explained simply. If a novice reader would feel lost or intimidated, revise until they wouldn't.

**This means:**
- Short sentences when possible
- Plain words over technical jargon
- Explain concepts before using terminology
- One idea per paragraph
- No assumption of prior training

**Test:** Could someone with genuine interest but no vocal background follow this post and learn something useful?

### 2. Positive, Forward-Focused Framing
Lead with what something IS. State the positive directly and trust it to stand. Keep energy moving toward action, understanding, or possibility.

**Write:** "Consistent practice builds muscle memory and confidence."
**Avoid:** "Without consistent practice, you won't develop muscle memory or confidence."

**Write:** "A relaxed jaw allows for better resonance."
**Avoid:** "A tense jaw blocks resonance and limits your sound."

### 3. No Contrast Framing
Avoid the "not X, but Y" construction. Don't define things by what they're not. Don't circle back to explain what you don't mean.

**Write:** "This exercise builds breath support."
**Avoid:** "This isn't about holding your breathâ€”it's about support."

**Write:** "Focus on ease and connection."
**Avoid:** "Don't focus on power or volumeâ€”focus on ease and connection."

If you find yourself writing "not," "don't," "isn't," or "won't" â€” pause and reframe.

## Voice & Perspective

**First person, personal experience grounded.**
Write as Ted â€” a teacher sharing what he's learned from four decades of working with voices. Use "I" freely. Reference real teaching moments (anonymized as needed). The reader should feel like they're learning from someone who's been in the room with hundreds of students, not reading a textbook.

**Examples:**
- "I see this pattern often with new students..."
- "One thing I've learned after forty years..."
- "Here's what I tell my clients when this comes up..."

**Avoid:**
- Generic "experts say" framing
- Overly academic tone
- Writing that could have been written by anyone
- Distant, impersonal instruction

---

## Accessibility in Practice

### Sophisticated Topics, Simple Language

Voice science, anatomy, and technique can get complex. Your job is to make it approachable.

**Strategies:**
- **Analogy first, terminology second.** "Think of your diaphragm like a trampoline for your breath" before diving into mechanics.
- **Define as you go.** "Resonanceâ€”the way sound vibrates and amplifies in your throat, mouth, and headâ€”is what gives your voice its richness."
- **Use the reader's experience.** "You know that feeling when you yawn and your throat opens up? That's the space we're looking for."
- **Check your assumptions.** Don't assume readers know what "placement" or "support" or "head voice" means.

### Paragraph & Sentence Structure

- **Paragraphs:** 2-4 sentences ideal. One-sentence paragraphs fine for emphasis.
- **Sentences:** Vary length for rhythm, but favor shorter. If a sentence has more than one comma, consider splitting it.
- **One idea per paragraph.** If you're covering two concepts, use two paragraphs.

### Scannability

Blog readers scan before they commit to reading. Help them.

- **Clear headings** that describe what follows
- **Short paragraphs** with visual breathing room
- **Bullet points** when listing tips, steps, or options
- **Bold key phrases** sparingly for emphasis
- **Lead with the useful** â€” don't bury the good stuff

---

## Tone Calibration

**Educational, not preachy.**
Share knowledge generously. Explain the "why" behind recommendations. Avoid finger-wagging or making readers feel bad about what they don't know.

**Encouraging, not cheerleader.**
Acknowledge that vocal development takes time and effort. Celebrate progress honestly. Skip empty hype and vague praise.

**Confident, not arrogant.**
Speak from experience and expertise. Stay curious â€” the voice is endlessly complex, and there's always more to learn.

**Conversational, not casual.**
Write like you're explaining something to a smart adult who respects your expertise. Warm but professional.

**Patient, not condescending.**
Meet readers where they are. Assume they're capable of understanding if you explain well.

## Positive Framing in Practice

### Reframe Problems as Opportunities

**Instead of:** "Many singers struggle with breath support because they never learned proper technique."
**Write:** "Breath support is one of the most rewarding skills to develop. Once it clicks, everything else gets easier."

### Focus on What To Do

**Instead of:** "Don't push from your throat."
**Write:** "Let the breath do the work. Your throat stays relaxed."

### Celebrate the Path

**Instead of:** "Most people give up before they see results."
**Write:** "Progress often comes in waves. Staying consistent through the plateaus is where real growth happens."

### Acknowledge Difficulty Without Dwelling

**Instead of:** "This is hard and many people fail at it."
**Write:** "This takes practice. Give yourself time."

## SEO Considerations

**Titles that work for search.**
Clear, specific titles outperform clever ones. "How to Warm Up Your Voice Before a Performance" beats "Getting Ready to Shine."

**Use natural keyword language.**
Think about what someone would type into Google. Use those phrases naturally in headings and body copy. Don't stuff keywords â€” write for humans first.

**Answer real questions.**
Many strong blog posts answer a question someone is actually asking: "Why does my voice get tired?" "How do I sing higher without strain?" "What should I do before an audition?"

**Aim for depth.**
Longer, thorough posts (800-1500+ words) tend to perform better in search than thin ones. But don't pad â€” if a topic needs 500 words, write 500 good words.

---

## Opening & Closing Patterns

**Opening:**
Get into the topic quickly. You can start with:
- A question the reader might be asking
- A common situation they'd recognize
- A brief observation from teaching
- A reframe that shifts perspective

Avoid long wind-ups. Respect the reader's time.

**Closing:**
End with forward motion:
- A summary of key takeaways
- An encouragement to try something
- A prompt to reach out for deeper work
- A connection to the bigger picture

Include a soft CTA when natural (discovery call, related post) but don't make every post feel like a sales pitch.

---

## Technical & Terminology Notes

**Introduce, then use.**
Technical terms are fine when they're useful â€” but always explain them on first use. A reader shouldn't need prior training to follow along.

**Align with AVF/PASS language.**
When discussing concepts covered in the Adaptive Voice Framework or PASS Profile, use consistent terminology:
- Five Pillars: Body Organization, Breath, Phonation, Resonance, Expression
- Eight Dials: as defined in AVF
- PASS language: "peaks and valleys" (not "strengths and weaknesses")

**Plain words win.**
"Breath support" is clear. "Appoggio-based intercostal-diaphragmatic antagonism" is not.

## Length Guidelines

| Post Type | Typical Length |
|-----------|----------------|
| Quick tip or single concept | 400-600 words |
| Standard educational post | 800-1200 words |
| Deep dive or comprehensive guide | 1500-2500 words |
| Local/event-focused post | 500-800 words |

Let the content dictate the length. Thorough beats padded.

---

## Categories

Assign each post to a single primary category:

1. **Vocal Health** â€” Care, maintenance, warm-ups, recovery, vocal problems
2. **Technique** â€” Breath, resonance, phonation, diction, mechanics
3. **Performance** â€” Stage presence, auditions, confidence, audience connection
4. **Mindset & Practice** â€” Growth, consistency, practice habits, mental game
5. **For Professionals** â€” Career, teaching, industry, business communication

If a post spans categories, pick the primary one. Tags can capture secondary topics.
