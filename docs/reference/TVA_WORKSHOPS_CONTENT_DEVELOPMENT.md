## CURRENT DRAFT COPY

Below is the approved v1 copy. Use this as your starting point.

### HERO SECTION

**Headline:** Teaching Voice from the Inside Out

**Subhead:** Interactive workshops that help singers and speakers understand how the voice actually worksâ€”so they can use it with greater confidence, clarity, and purpose.

**Body:**
I offer educational workshops for groups, organizations, and events. Whether you're looking for a featured session at your conference, a retreat experience for your choir, or a structured series for your team, I bring the same approach: clear frameworks, hands-on exploration, and practical understanding that participants carry forward.

### SECTION 1: THE AVF WORKSHOP SERIES

**Headline:** The AVF Workshop Series

**Body:**
This is my signature educational offeringâ€”a live, in-person workshop series grounded in the Adaptive Voice Framework (AVF).

The series begins with a shared session for all participants, then continues in two focused paths: one for singers, one for speakers. Each path includes three workshops total (including the shared first session), with each session lasting two hours.

**What participants experience:**
- A clear, system-level understanding of how the voice works
- Hands-on exploration of the Five Pillars and Eight Dials
- Practical awareness they can apply immediately
- Language for describing and developing their own voice
- Confidence in using their voice across varied contexts

The series is designed with a low floor and high ceilingâ€”accessible to beginners while remaining valuable for experienced singers and speakers.

Every participant receives a copy of *AVF: The Adaptive Voice Framework* as part of the experience. The book serves as a shared reference during workshops and a resource for continued learning afterward.

**For speakers:** The speaking path integrates the PASS Profileâ€”my proprietary communication assessment that maps how each participant naturally communicates. This adds personalized insight and language that supports intentional, authentic speaking.

**Subsection: Bring the Series to Your Organization**
The AVF Workshop Series can be delivered as a private experience for your group, retreat, or event. I'll work with you to adapt the format to your needs while maintaining the core learning arc.

**Subsection: Public Workshop Dates**
I'll be announcing public workshop dates soon. If you'd like to be notified when registration opens, let me know.

### SECTION 2: INVITED TEACHING & PRESENTATIONS

**Headline:** Conference Sessions & Vocal Education Events

**Body:**
I'm available for invited teaching at conferences, harmony schools, and vocal education events. Past and current contexts include events like Harmony College Northwest, Harmony University, and professional voice conferences.

**What I bring:**
- A clear, practical approach to understanding how the voice works
- Content shaped to fit your audience and event goals
- Sessions that are both useful and enjoyable to attend
- Tools and ideas participants can put to use right away

Sessions can range from a single breakout to multi-session intensives. I'm happy to discuss what would serve your event best.

### SECTION 3: CUSTOM WORKSHOPS FOR ORGANIZATIONS

**Headline:** Custom Workshops for Groups & Teams

**Body:**
Looking to bring voice education to your chorus, quartet, team, or organization? I design custom workshops tailored to your group's focus and goals.

**For singers and ensembles:**
- Building a strong foundation: breath, tone, unity, and healthy singing habits
- Understanding the voice as a balanced, responsive system
- Leveling up: moving beyond "correct" into expressive, artistic singing
- Performance skills and stage presence
- Genuine engagement and authentic performance
- Musicality and artistry that connects with audiences
- Vocal health and sustainable singing
- Warm-up design and daily practice frameworks
- How to run an effective sectional rehearsal (for section leaders and directors)

**For speakers and professional teams:**
- Communication style awareness featuring the PASS Profile
- Developing your own speaking style and personal voice brand
- Speaking with confidence and authenticity
- Expressive clarity for presenters and leaders
- Voice use in professional settings

These workshops work well for choir retreats, quartet coaching intensives, leadership teams, professional development days, and organizational offsites.

## KEY STRUCTURAL DECISIONS NEEDED

### Decision 1: Page Architecture
**Question:** Single page with all workshop types, or individual sub-pages?

**Option A â€” Single Page:**
- All content on `/workshops`
- Visitors see everything at once
- Good for SEO (one strong page)
- Simpler to maintain

**Option B â€” Hub + Sub-pages:**
- `/workshops` as overview
- `/workshops/avf-series`, `/workshops/custom`, `/workshops/conference`
- Allows more depth per offering
- Better for long-form descriptions

**Your preference?**

### Decision 2: AVF Workshop Series Detail
The current copy describes the structure broadly. Questions to consider:

- **Do you want to list specific session titles/topics?**
  - Session 1: [Title] â€” [Description]
  - Session 2 (Singers): [Title]
  - Session 2 (Speakers): [Title]
  - etc.

- **Should the series structure have a visual diagram?**
  - Shared Session â†’ Singer Path / Speaker Path branching visual

- **What does pricing look like?**
  - Per person for public workshops?
  - Flat fee for private organizational delivery?
  - Should pricing be on the page or "contact for quote"?

### Decision 3: Public Workshop Dates
The copy mentions announcing dates "soon."

**Questions:**
- Do you have dates planned?
- Should there be a registration system?
- Or just an interest list / email capture for now?
- Where would registration happen? (Eventbrite? Your site? Manually?)

### Decision 4: Conference/Event Credentials
The copy mentions Harmony College Northwest and Harmony University.

**Questions:**
- Any other events to list?
- Should there be a "Past Events" or "Where I've Taught" section with logos/names?
- Any testimonials from event organizers?

### Decision 5: Workshop Topics List
The custom workshops section lists many potential topics.

**Questions:**
- Is this list complete? Anything to add or remove?
- Should topics have brief descriptions?
- Are some more popular than others (worth featuring)?

### Decision 6: Inquiry Process
Currently all CTAs route to contact.

**Questions:**
- Do you want a separate workshop inquiry form?
- What information do you need from potential clients?
  - Type of event
  - Approximate group size

## QUESTIONS TO START

1. Single page or hub with sub-pages?
2. How detailed should the AVF Workshop Series description be?
3. Do you have public workshop dates to announce, or is this "coming soon"?
4. Do you want to list past events/credentials?
5. Should there be a dedicated workshop inquiry form?

Let's work through these, then develop the content.
