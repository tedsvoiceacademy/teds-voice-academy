**Content:**
- Brief intro framing vocal health as ongoing care (not emergency repair)

- Gargle recipes Ted recommends
- Teas and soothing drinks
- Lozenges (what to look for, what to avoid)
- Supplements to consider
- Steam and humidity

**Format:** Ted's personal recommendations with rationale â€” not an exhaustive list, but a curated guide from someone who's tested these things.

**Potential:** Could link to products Ted trusts (recommendation style, not inventory-based retail)

---

### Sub-section 4: SOVT Tools & Techniques

**Ted's expertise area** â€” draws on Singevity experience and years of practice

**Content:**
- What SOVT (Semi-Occluded Vocal Tract) is and why it helps
- Exercises:
  - Straw phonation
  - Lip trills
  - Tongue trills
  - Humming
  - Cup bubbling
- Tools Ted recommends:
  - Pocket Vox

**What it is:** Ted's vocal conditioning exercise series â€” rebranded from earlier product

**Content:**
- Description of what Vocal Fit includes
- Who it's for
- Purchase/download option (secure delivery system TBD during technical build)

**Technical requirement:** Needs secure digital product delivery system (purchase â†’ download access)

**Future potential:** Room for additional digital products as Ted develops them

---

### Sub-section 6: Articles & Resources

**Content:**
- Curated collection of Ted's written pieces on vocal health topics
- Links to relevant blog posts (cross-reference with Blog)
- Could grow into a mini-library over time

**Purpose:** Gives Ted a home for vocal health content that doesn't fit the blog format, plus surfaces older valuable content

---

## DESIGN/LAYOUT NOTES

- Hub landing page should feel welcoming and navigable â€” not overwhelming
- Sub-sections could be:
  - Separate pages (more room, better for SEO)
  - OR accordion/expandable sections on one long page (simpler navigation)
  - Decision to be made during technical build
- Medical disclaimer should be visible but not alarming
- Warm, caring tone throughout â€” this reflects Ted's genuine passion for vocal health

---

## BACKGROUND CONTEXT (For future reference)

Ted's history with vocal health products:
- Ran Singevity business several years ago with a partner
- Sold SOVT devices (Pocket Vox), lozenges, teas at barbershop events
- Purchased $5,000 inventory from Turkish laryngologist supplier
- Sold out at two weekend events within weeks
- Decided retail wasn't his main passion; let the business wind down
- Still passionate about promoting vocal health â€” this hub channels that passion into education and digital products rather than physical inventory
