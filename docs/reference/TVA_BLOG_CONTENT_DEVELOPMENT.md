# BLOG SECTION â€” CONTENT DEVELOPMENT SESSION

## Purpose
This chat is dedicated to developing content and making structural decisions for the Blog section of tedsvoiceacademy.com. Your decisions here will shape how the blog gets built.

## WHO YOU ARE (for Claude's context)

**Ted Chamberlain** â€” Owner of Ted's Voice Academy, a voice coaching business in Lacey, Washington. Four decades of teaching experience. You've developed:
- **The Adaptive Voice Framework (AVF)** â€” A comprehensive voice teaching system, published as a ~700-page book
- **The PASS Profile** â€” A professional communication assessment

You have existing blog content to migrate (~20-30 posts from your current site). The blog is positioned as a generous educational resource, not a marketing funnel.

## YOUR COMMUNICATION STYLE: "FORWARD LIGHT"

All content must follow these principles:
- **Positive framing** â€” State what something IS, not what it isn't
- **No contrast constructions** â€” Never "not X, but Y"
- **8th grade reading level** â€” Accessible, plain language
- **First person** â€” Always I/me (you ARE the business)
- **Warm, direct, genuine** â€” Like a trusted teacher sharing knowledge

A **Blog Writing Style Guide** exists with detailed guidance (included below for reference).

## CURRENT DRAFT COPY

### HERO SECTION

**Headline:** Ideas, insights, and practical guidance for your voice

**Subhead:** Whether you sing, speak, or bothâ€”there's something here for you.

---

### INTRO SECTION

I write about the voice because I find it endlessly fascinatingâ€”and because I believe everyone deserves access to good information about how their instrument works.

These posts explore technique, health, performance, and the mindset behind vocal development. Some are deep dives. Some are quick tips. All of them come from four decades of teaching, performing, and learning alongside my students.

Browse by topic below, or scroll through the latest posts.

### CATEGORIES (5 total, locked)

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Vocal Health** | Taking care of your voice so it can take care of you. Warm-ups, recovery, hydration, and what to do when something feels off. |
| **Technique** | The how and why behind breath support, resonance, phonation, and articulationâ€”the physical foundations of good singing and speaking. |
| **Performance** | What happens when you step in front of an audience. Stage presence, audition preparation, and connecting with listeners. |
| **Mindset & Practice** | The mental and emotional side of vocal development. Confidence, consistency, and the long game of getting better. |
| **For Professionals** | Guidance for those building a career with their voiceâ€”teaching, industry insights, and communication in business contexts. |

**Note:** AVF and PASS concepts are woven throughout posts as teaching tools, not isolated in their own category.

**Headline:** Want to go deeper?

**Body:** Reading is a great start. Working together is where real progress happens. If something here sparks a question or a goal, I'd love to hear about it.

## KEY STRUCTURAL DECISIONS NEEDED

### Decision 1: Category Pages
**Question:** Should each category have its own landing page?

**Option A â€” No Category Pages:**
- Blog landing page shows all posts
- Categories are filter buttons only
- Simpler to build

**Option B â€” Category Landing Pages:**
- `/blog/vocal-health`, `/blog/technique`, etc.
- Each with its own intro and curated post list
- Better for SEO and organization
- More pages to maintain

**Your preference?**

### Decision 2: Tag System
Beyond the 5 categories, do you want a tag system?

**Examples:**
- Tags like: "beginners," "advanced," "AVF," "PASS," "auditions," "aging voice," "teachers"
- Posts could have multiple tags (but only one category)
- Tags could appear on posts and be searchable

**Do you want tags?** If yes, what tags would be useful?

### Decision 3: Content Migration
You have ~20-30 existing posts to migrate.

**Questions:**
- Do you want to migrate all of them, or curate which ones move over?
- Do any need revision for Forward Light consistency?
- Should some be consolidated or updated?
- Do you have a list of existing posts?

### Decision 4: Launch Content
**Question:** How many posts should be live at launch?

Options:
- Migrate existing content = 20-30 posts ready
- Curate a smaller set = 10-15 strongest posts
- Start fresh = 3-5 new cornerstone posts

**Your preference?**

### Decision 5: Post Frequency & Planning
**Questions:**
- How often do you want to publish? (Weekly? Twice monthly? Monthly?)
- Do you want a content calendar?
- Should we plan initial post topics now?

### Decision 6: Search Functionality
**Question:** Do you want a search bar on the blog?

- Useful as content library grows
- Not essential at launch
- Can add later

### Decision 7: Newsletter Integration
The copy mentions "future consideration" for email signup.

**Questions:**
- Do you plan to add a newsletter?
- Should we design space for it now (even if not functional at launch)?
- What email platform would you use? (Mailchimp? ConvertKit? Other?)

### Decision 8: Individual Post Template
Each post needs a consistent template. Confirm these elements:

Standard elements:
- Title
- Date
- Category tag
- Author byline (Ted Chamberlain)
- Body content
- Related posts at bottom
- CTA at bottom

**Questions:**
- Estimated reading time? (e.g., "5 min read")
- Social sharing buttons?
- Comments? (Probably no, but confirming)

## CONTENT TO DEVELOP

### Blog Landing Page
The current copy is solid. Main decisions are structural (above).

### Category Descriptions
If you want category landing pages, we need expanded descriptions for each.

### Cornerstone Posts
Consider identifying 1-2 "cornerstone" posts per category â€” comprehensive, evergreen posts that represent your best thinking on key topics.

**Examples:**
- Vocal Health: "The Complete Guide to Warming Up Your Voice"
- Technique: "Understanding Breath Support: What It Really Means"
- Performance: "How to Prepare for an Audition"
- Mindset: "The Long Game: Why Consistent Practice Beats Intensity"
- For Professionals: "Building a Voice Teaching Business"

**Do you want to plan cornerstone content now?**

### Content Ideas
If you want to brainstorm post topics for the first few months, we can develop a content calendar.

## BLOG WRITING STYLE GUIDE (REFERENCE)

### Voice & Perspective
Write as Ted â€” a teacher sharing what he's learned from four decades of working with voices. Use "I" freely. Reference real teaching moments (anonymized). The reader should feel like they're learning from someone who's been in the room with hundreds of students.

### Structure
- **Paragraphs:** 2-4 sentences ideal
- **Sentences:** Favor shorter, vary for rhythm
- **Headings:** Clear, descriptive
- **Scannability:** Short paragraphs, bullet points when listing

### Post Types & Lengths
| Post Type | Length |
|-----------|--------|
| Quick tip | 400-600 words |
| Standard educational | 800-1200 words |
| Deep dive/guide | 1500-2500 words |
| Local/event-focused | 500-800 words |

### Opening Pattern
Get into the topic quickly:
- A question the reader might be asking
- A common situation they'd recognize
- A brief observation from teaching
- A reframe that shifts perspective

### Closing Pattern
End with forward motion:
- Summary of key takeaways
- Encouragement to try something
- Prompt to reach out for deeper work
- Connection to the bigger picture

### SEO Considerations
- Clear, specific titles over clever ones
- Natural keyword language
- Answer real questions people search for
- Aim for depth (800-1500+ words for strong posts)
