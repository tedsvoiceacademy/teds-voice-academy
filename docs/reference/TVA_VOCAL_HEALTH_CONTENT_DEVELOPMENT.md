# VOCAL HEALTH HUB â€” CONTENT DEVELOPMENT SESSION

## Purpose
This chat is dedicated to developing content and making structural decisions for the Vocal Health section of tedsvoiceacademy.com. Your decisions here will shape how the page gets built.

## WHO YOU ARE (for Claude's context)

**Ted Chamberlain** â€” Owner of Ted's Voice Academy, a voice coaching business in Lacey, Washington. Four decades of teaching experience. You've developed:
- **The Adaptive Voice Framework (AVF)** â€” A comprehensive voice teaching system, published as a ~700-page book
- **The PASS Profile** â€” A professional communication assessment
- **Vocal Health expertise** â€” From your previous Singevity business and ongoing client work

You're building a new website. This Vocal Health section represents one of your three "authority pillars" alongside AVF and PASS Profile.

## YOUR COMMUNICATION STYLE: "FORWARD LIGHT"

All content must follow these principles:
- **Positive framing** â€” State what something IS, not what it isn't
- **No contrast constructions** â€” Never "not X, but Y"
- **8th grade reading level** â€” Accessible, plain language
- **First person** â€” Always I/me (you ARE the business)
- **Warm, direct, genuine** â€” Like a trusted teacher sharing knowledge

**Example of contrast to AVOID:**
"This isn't about holding your breathâ€”it's about support."

**Write instead:**
"This exercise builds breath support."

## CURRENT DRAFT COPY

Below is the existing draft. Use this as your starting point. You can expand, revise, restructure, and fill in placeholders.

### LANDING PAGE

**Headline:** Your voice deserves good care

**Intro Copy:**
A healthy voice is built through daily habits, simple practices, and small choices that keep your voice resilient over time.

I've spent years learning what helps voices stay strong â€” and what helps them recover when they're tired or strained. This section shares what I've learned: practical guidance you can use whether you're maintaining a healthy voice or working your way back from a rough stretch.

**Medical Disclaimer:**
*I'm a voice teacher, not a medical professional. The information here is educational â€” it's not a substitute for medical advice. If you're experiencing persistent vocal problems, pain, or any symptoms that concern you, please consult a physician or voice-specialized medical professional.*

### PROPOSED SUB-SECTIONS (6 total)

1. **Foundations** â€” Hydration, rest, environment, vocal hygiene (MOSTLY WRITTEN)
2. **When Things Feel Off** â€” Fatigue, overuse, warning signs, when to seek help (MOSTLY WRITTEN)
3. **Home Care & Remedies** â€” Gargles, teas, lozenges, steam (PARTIALLY WRITTEN)
4. **SOVT Tools & Techniques** â€” Semi-occluded exercises and tools (PLACEHOLDER - needs your input)

6. **Articles & Resources** â€” Blog cross-references, external links (PLACEHOLDER)

## KEY STRUCTURAL DECISIONS NEEDED

### Decision 1: Hub Architecture
**Question:** Is this ONE long page with sections, or a HUB that links to individual sub-pages?

**Option A â€” Single Page:**
- All content on `/vocal-health`
- Easier to build and maintain
- Risk: Could get very long

**Option B â€” Hub + Sub-pages:**
- `/vocal-health` as overview with navigation cards
- `/vocal-health/foundations`, `/vocal-health/sovt`, etc.
- More organized for lots of content
- More pages to build and maintain

**Your preference?**

### Decision 2: Vocal Fit Integration
**Question:** What IS Vocal Fit exactly, and how should it appear here?

Things to clarify:
- Is this a product line? (Digital downloads? Videos? PDFs?)
- What routines exist or are planned?
- Are they for purchase or free?
- Where do people buy them? (Gumroad? Your site?)
- Should Vocal Fit have its own page outside the Vocal Health section?

### Decision 3: SOVT Content Depth
The SOVT section has placeholders. You need to provide:
- Your explanation of why SOVT works (in your voice)
- Which exercises you recommend and how to do them
- Which tools you recommend (Pocket Vox, straws, etc.)
- When/how to use SOVT (warm-up, cool-down, recovery, daily maintenance)

**How much detail do you want here?** Quick overview that points to coaching, or comprehensive self-serve resource?

### Decision 4: Product Recommendations
Several sections mention potential product recommendations (nebulizers, humidifiers, throat lozenges, etc.)

**Questions:**
- Do you want to recommend specific products by name/brand?
- Any affiliate relationships to consider?
- Or keep it generic ("use a personal nebulizer")?

### Decision 5: Practitioner Referrals
The "When Things Feel Off" section discusses when to seek professional help.

**Do you want to:**
- List specific local practitioners you refer to?
- Explain how to find a voice specialist generally?
- Both?

This format will drop cleanly into the main build session.

## HELPFUL CONTEXT

**Your mantras:**
- "Good singing is good singing â€” the rest is just notes"
- "You are better at being you than anyone else will ever be"
- "Expression drives the voice; technique serves expression"

**Your approach:** You build "well-balanced voices" using the Five Pillars (Body Organization, Breath, Phonation, Resonance, Expression) and emphasize understanding the "why" and "how."

**Your audience:** Complete beginners to experienced performers. All ages 14+. Especially strong with voice recovery cases.

## QUESTIONS TO START

1. Hub architecture: Single page or hub with sub-pages?
2. What exactly is Vocal Fit and how should it be positioned?
3. How comprehensive should the SOVT section be?
4. Do you want to name specific products/practitioners?

Let's work through these, then develop the content.
