**Body Copy:**
I write about the voice because I find it endlessly fascinatingâ€”and because I believe everyone deserves access to good information about how their instrument works.

These posts explore technique, health, performance, and the mindset behind vocal development. Some are deep dives. Some are quick tips. All of them come from four decades of teaching, performing, and learning alongside my students.

## NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

1. **Category navigation:** 5 categories displayed as clickable cards or buttons. Consider subtle icons or color accents for each. Cards lead to filtered category views.

2. **Recent posts feed:** Display 6-8 most recent posts with:
   - Title (linked to full post)
   - Date
   - Short excerpt (first 1-2 sentences or custom excerpt)
   - Category tag

3. **Post cards:** Clean, readable design. Ted's content is text-forwardâ€”no need for heavy imagery. A consistent placeholder image or category-specific accent color works well.

4. **Search functionality:** Consider adding search as content library grows. Not essential at launch.

5. **Pagination:** "Load more" button for archive browsing.

6. **Category pages:** Each category gets its own landing with:
   - Category name and description
   - All posts in that category (newest first)
   - Link back to main blog

7. **Individual post template:**
   - Title, date, category tag
   - Body content (headers, lists, images, pull quotes supported)
   - Author byline (Ted Chamberlain)
   - Related posts suggestion
   - CTA at bottom

8. **SEO implementation:**
   - Customizable meta title/description per post
   - Article schema markup
   - Category pages with unique meta descriptions
   - Clean URL structure: /blog/post-title-here

9. **Future consideration:** Email newsletter signup. Leave design space for this if Ted adds email marketing later.

10. **Migration:** ~20-30 existing posts to migrate from current site. Some may need light editing for Forward Light consistency and category assignment.
