## HERO SECTION

**[Layout: Two-column or centered hero. Feature the PASS Profile logo prominently. Consider using fingerprint visual motif.]**

### Headline:
Your speaking style is as unique as your fingerprint

### Subhead:
A professional communication assessment that reveals how you naturally communicate â€” so you can use it with intention.

### Body:
PASS Profile measures your communication behaviors in workplace settings. Through 60 real-world scenarios, it captures how you actually communicate and interact at work â€” who you already are when you're doing your best work.

The result is your communication fingerprint: a pattern of 40 traits across six domains that shows your natural strengths, where your style excels, and how to leverage it in any professional context.

With more unique combinations than atoms in the observable universe, it's virtually impossible for two people to share the same exact communication style. Yours is genuinely yours.

## WHAT PASS PROFILE MEASURES

### Headline:
What it measures

### Body:
PASS Profile examines your communication patterns across six domains:

**Communication Purpose** â€” What drives you when you communicate. Are you drawn to building relationships or achieving outcomes? Understanding others or influencing them?

**Thinking Style** â€” How you process and share ideas. Big-picture or detail-oriented? Linear or flexible? Analytical or intuitive?

**Relational Approach** â€” How you navigate human dynamics. Direct or diplomatic? Task-focused or people-focused?

**Temporal & Decisional Orientation** â€” Your relationship with time and decisions. Future-focused or present-focused? Deliberate or quick?

**Social Positioning** â€” Your natural role in groups. Leading or supporting? Visible or behind-the-scenes? Collaborative or independent?

**Adaptability** â€” How consistently or flexibly you communicate across situations.

Within these six domains, PASS measures 40 specific traits. Together, they create your unique communication fingerprint.

---

## HOW SCORES WORK

### Headline:
Understanding your scores

### Body:
Each of your 40 traits is measured on a scale from 0 to 100. These scores represent where you naturally fall on a continuum of communication tendencies.

**Higher scores (70-100)** indicate natural strengths â€” patterns that come easily and typically energize you.

**Mid-range scores (40-69)** show flexibility â€” you adapt your approach based on context and situation. This versatility is itself a strength.

**Lower scores (0-39)** reveal distinctive features of your style. Every pattern has contexts where it excels. Your valleys help define what makes your fingerprint unique.

Here's what matters most: **your valleys are as important as your peaks.** Someone with high Empathy and low Directness is defined by both scores together. The combination creates your unique communication fingerprint.

Your report analyzes all 40 trait scores together â€” how they combine and interact is what makes your pattern genuinely yours.

---

## HOW IT'S DIFFERENT

### Headline:
How PASS Profile is different

### Body:
You may have taken assessments like DISC, Myers-Briggs, or CliftonStrengths. They measure broad personality traits and sort you into types. PASS Profile offers something different.

**Communication-specific.** PASS focuses on how you communicate and interact in professional settings â€” the behaviors that shape your daily work relationships and effectiveness.

**Scenario-based.** PASS presents real workplace situations and asks what you actually do. This captures your authentic patterns in action.

**Truly individual.** Most assessments sort you into one of 4, 16, or 34 types. PASS generates more unique combinations than atoms in the observable universe â€” making it virtually impossible for two people to share the same exact profile.

**100% asset-based.** Every trait represents a strength in certain contexts. Your unique pattern shows where you naturally excel and how to leverage your tendencies with intention.

---

## WHAT YOU'LL RECEIVE

### Headline:
What you'll receive

### Body:
After completing the assessment (30â€“60 minutes), you'll receive a comprehensive PDF report â€” typically 46-48 pages â€” delivered to your email.

Your report draws on all 40 of your trait scores to create a complete picture of your communication style. Every insight reflects how your full pattern works together â€” peaks and valleys alike.

**Your report includes:**

**Your Communication Style Title** â€” A personalized title that captures your distinctive pattern (like "Context-Aware Communicator" or "Strategic Relationship Builder").

**Communication Fingerprint** â€” A radar chart visualization of your six domain scores, showing your unique pattern at a glance.

**Top 10 Natural Strengths** â€” Your highest-scoring traits, ranked and explained â€” with context for how they interact with your complete pattern.

**Score Distribution & Balance Wheel** â€” Visual representations of how your 40 traits distribute across the spectrum.

**Six Domain Deep-Dives** â€” Detailed analysis of each domain with personalized insights and practical applications (~2 pages each).

**Situational Effectiveness Map** â€” Where your style naturally excels, and contexts where you might consciously expand your range.

**Career Contexts** â€” How your pattern shows up across 15 different professional contexts, with specific insights for each.

**Practical Scenarios** â€” Six common workplace situations with personalized guidance based on your pattern.

**Similar Well-Known Communicator** â€” A public figure who shares your communication patterns, with insights on what you can learn from their approach.

**Working With Others** â€” A shareable section designed for colleagues, helping them understand how to communicate effectively with you.

**90-Day Development Roadmap** â€” Practical steps for leveraging your strengths and expanding your range.

**Quick Reference Card** â€” A one-page summary for daily use.

## WHO IT'S FOR

### Headline:
Who PASS Profile is for

### Body:
Communication is at the heart of all human interaction. How you communicate shapes your relationships, your effectiveness, and your experience at work. Understanding your natural patterns â€” and learning to leverage them â€” has profound implications.

**Professionals at any stage** who want to communicate with more clarity, confidence, and intention. When you understand your style, you experience greater job satisfaction, fewer workplace conflicts, improved productivity, and stronger professional relationships.

**Leaders and managers** who want to understand how their communication style impacts their teams â€” and how to adapt when the situation calls for it.

**People in transition** â€” new role, promotion, career change, or team reorganization â€” who want to communicate with confidence in a new context.

**Teams and organizations** seeking better collaboration. When team members understand each other's communication patterns, they work together more effectively â€” leading to improved performance and stronger outcomes.

**Coaches, consultants, and HR professionals** looking for a diagnostic foundation for development conversations and team building.

**Educational institutions** preparing students for professional communication in the workforce.

**High-stakes communicators** â€” leaders, medical professionals, attorneys, educators, and anyone whose effectiveness depends on clear, intentional communication.

## HOW IT WORKS

### Headline:
How it works

### Body:
**Step 1: Purchase and log in.**
After checkout, you'll receive login credentials to access the assessment platform.

**Step 2: Complete the assessment.**
You'll encounter 60 workplace scenarios. For each one, you'll rate four possible responses on a scale of 1â€“5 based on how much each sounds like you. Every option reflects a valid professional approach â€” there are no right or wrong answers.

The assessment takes 30â€“60 minutes. Each scenario has a "Save and Exit" button, so you can stop anytime and return later to pick up where you left off.

**Step 3: Receive your report.**
Once complete, your personalized PDF report is generated and delivered to your email â€” typically within minutes.

**Step 4: Apply what you learn.**
Use your report to communicate with more intention. Share the "Working With Others" section with colleagues. Follow the 90-day roadmap. Return to your report whenever you face new situations or decisions.

**Optional: Book a coaching session.**
I offer one-on-one sessions (in person or virtually) to explore your results in depth and apply them to specific professional challenges.

## PASS IN MY COACHING PRACTICE

### Headline:
How I use PASS Profile in coaching

### Body:
PASS Profile started as a tool I developed for my speaking clients. When someone comes to me wanting to communicate with more clarity, confidence, or presence, understanding their natural communication patterns gives us a powerful starting point.

The assessment reveals what they're already doing well â€” so we can build on it. It shows where their style naturally excels â€” so they can seek out those situations. And it highlights opportunities to expand their range when certain contexts call for a different approach.

For professionals working on communication presence and impact, the assessment is often transformative. For clients focused on vocal technique, projection, or accent work, we may take a different path. Every client's needs are unique.

---

## BEYOND THE STUDIO

### Headline:
PASS Profile beyond the studio

### Body:
While I developed PASS for my coaching practice, the assessment has applications well beyond one-on-one work.

**For coaches and consultants** â€” Use PASS as a diagnostic foundation with your own clients. The detailed report accelerates coaching conversations and provides shared vocabulary for discussing communication patterns.

**For HR and team leaders** â€” Help employees understand their communication strengths and how to work effectively with colleagues who communicate differently. Teams that understand each other collaborate better â€” with fewer conflicts and stronger results.

**For educational institutions** â€” Prepare students and graduates to understand and articulate their professional communication style as they enter the workforce.

**For high-stakes communicators** â€” Leaders, politicians, medical professionals, attorneys, and anyone whose effectiveness depends on clear, intentional communication.

If you're interested in using PASS Profile in your organization or practice, reach out. I'm actively developing team workshops and organizational applications.

## TERMINOLOGY NOTES

| Use | Notes |
|-----|-------|
| "Communication fingerprint" | Core metaphor â€” use consistently |
| "Communication behaviors" | What PASS measures |
| "More unique combinations than atoms in the observable universe" | Scale framing |
| "Virtually impossible for two people to share the same exact communication style" | Individuality framing |
| "100% asset-based" | Every trait excels in certain contexts |
| "Speaking style" or "communication style" | Interchangeable |
| "Professional communication/settings" | PASS focus |
| "Leverage" | Key action word for using your patterns intentionally |
| "Peaks and valleys" | Both define uniqueness; valleys are as important as peaks |
| "Distinctive features" | How to describe lower scores (not weaknesses) |
| "Communication Style title" | Personalized title like "Context-Aware Communicator" |

**Scoring language:**
- Higher scores = natural strengths, energizing patterns
- Mid-range scores = flexibility, adaptability (itself a strength)
- Lower scores = distinctive features that help define uniqueness
- All 40 traits considered together â€” the pattern matters
- Valleys are as important as peaks

**Avoid:**
- Specific numbers for combinations (the math is 5^240 â‰ˆ 10^168)
- "Personality test" â€” PASS measures behaviors, not personality
- "Hiring tool" or "screening" â€” explicitly not for that purpose
- Contrast framing ("not X, but Y")
- Any implication that lower scores are worse or deficits
- "Weaknesses" â€” use "distinctive features" or "valleys"

---

## WHAT PASS PROFILE IS NOT

For clarity in all communications:

- A personality test (like Myers-Briggs or Enneagram) â€” PASS measures communication behaviors
- A measure of intelligence, competence, or ability
- A predictor of job performance
- A clinical or psychological assessment
- A hiring or screening tool
- A diagnosis of any kind

It is purely a professional development tool for self-awareness and intentional communication.
