## Forward Light Style | Draft v2

## HERO SECTION

**Page Title:**
Pricing & Packages

**Headline:**
Flexible options for every voice

**Subhead:**
Whether you're building a long-term practice, preparing for a specific goal, or exploring what coaching can offer, there's a path that fits.

---

## INTRO SECTION

**Body Copy:**
Every voice is different, and so is every coaching journey. Some clients thrive with weekly lessons and consistent momentum. Others prefer focused, short-term work around a specific goal. I've designed my offerings to meet you where you are and support the kind of progress you're seeking.

All sessions are 60 minutes and fully customized to your voice and goals.

---

## SINGING COACHING SECTION

**Section Headline:**
Singing Coaching

**Section Intro:**
Vocal and performance coaching for singers, typically ages 14 and up. Whether you're preparing for an audition, working through a technical challenge, or building a sustainable singing practice, these options give you the structure and flexibility to move forward.

---

### Monthly Plan (Recommended)

**Price:** $320/month

**Description:**
For singers committed to steady progress, the monthly plan offers the best value and consistency. You receive one 60-minute lesson per week, scheduled on a recurring day and time. This secures your lesson slot and gives you priority rescheduling when life happens.

The monthly rate accounts for holiday closures and a few floating weeks throughout the year. When possible, make-up sessions are offered for missed lessons due to illness or travel.

**Effective rate:** $80 per lesson

**Best for:** Singers building long-term skills, working toward auditions, or wanting consistent guidance

---

### Lesson Packages

**Description:**
Packages offer flexibility for clients who want to prepay for a set of lessons without committing to a weekly schedule. Sessions can be scheduled as frequently as twice a week or as occasionally as every few weeks. Packages are also available as gifts.

| Package | Price | Per Lesson |
|---------|-------|------------|
| 5 Lessons | $425 | $85 |
| 10 Lessons | $800 | $80 |
| 20 Lessons | $1,500 | $75 â€” Best Value |

**Best for:** Flexible schedules, gift purchases, short-term goals, or seasonal availability

---

### Single Sessions

**Price:** $100 per session

**Description:**
Single sessions work well for occasional check-ins, audition prep, or trying out a first lesson before committing to a package or plan.

**Best for:** New students exploring coaching, one-time performance preparation, occasional tune-ups

---

### Flagship Singing Series: The Sound of Confidence

**Price:** $400 total (4 sessions)

**Description:**
A focused 4-session series for singers ready to build real confidence in their voice. This track is designed for singers who have some experience but still hold backâ€”whether from pitch uncertainty, vocal tension, or self-doubt.

Over four sessions, we work on breath support, tone development, pitch stability, and emotional connection to the music. You'll leave with a voice that feels more consistent, expressive, and trustworthyâ€”and the understanding to keep growing on your own.

**What's included:**
- 4 private one-hour coaching sessions
- Personalized instruction for breath, tone, pitch, and presence
- Work on a song of your choice with expert guidance
- Tools and exercises for continued progress

**Best for:** Singers who want rapid, focused progress and a deeper understanding of their voice

## SPEAKING COACHING SECTION

**Section Headline:**
Speaking Coaching

---

### Flagship Speaking Series: The Voice of Impact

**Price:** $400 total (4 sessions)

**Description:**
A focused 4-session series for professionals who want their voice to match the strength of their ideas. Whether you're preparing for high-stakes presentations, leading meetings, or simply tired of second-guessing how you sound, this series helps you speak with clarity, presence, and credibility.

Over four sessions, we work on vocal tone, projection, pacing, and authentic delivery. You'll develop a voice that feels grounded, expressive, and fully aligned with your message and identity.

**What's included:**
- 4 private one-hour coaching sessions
- One PASS Profile assessment (my professional communication tool that reveals your natural communication style)
- Personalized coaching on breath, tone, clarity, and presence

**Best for:** Exploratory sessions, occasional coaching, or follow-up work

---

## HYBRID COACHING SECTION

**Section Headline:**
For Voices That Do Both

**Section Intro:**
Some voices don't fit neatly into "singing" or "speaking." If you're a worship leader, educator, coach, singer-songwriter, or anyone who uses your voice across multiple contexts, this track is designed for you.

---

### Flagship Hybrid Series: Singers Who Speak, Speakers Who Sing

**Price:** $400 total (4 sessions)

**Description:**
A focused 4-session series for people who use their voice in both musical and spoken settings. Whether you're a singer who teaches, a speaker who performs, or someone who moves fluidly between the two, this series helps you build one integrated voice with ease, clarity, and presence across everything you do.

Over four sessions, we work on breath coordination that serves both modes, resonance tuning for clarity and projection, and strategies for switching between speaking and singing without strain or fatigue.

**What's included:**
- 4 private one-hour coaching sessions
- Personalized instruction for vocal integration across speaking and singing
- Work on both a spoken piece and a song you use regularly
- Tools for vocal stamina and consistency

**Best for:** Worship leaders, music ministers, educators, coaches, singer-songwriters, podcasters, and anyone whose voice serves multiple purposes

## ENSEMBLE COACHING SECTION

**Section Headline:**
Ensemble Coaching

**Section Intro:**
Vocal and performance coaching for groups seeking unity, efficiency, and expressive sound. I work with barbershop quartets, contemporary a cappella groups, community choruses, and ensembles of all kinds.

---

### Custom Engagements

**Description:**
Ensemble coaching is tailored to your group's size, goals, and timeline. Options include one-time sessions, sectional intensives, show preparation, and multi-day retreat formats.

Each session is customized to your ensemble's priorities: tuning, vowel matching, performance delivery, interpretation, or stage presence. Both in-person and virtual options are available.

**Retreat Coaching:**
Planning a weekend retreat or special coaching event? I offer half-day, full-day, and multi-day engagements that bring clarity and cohesion to your ensemble's sound.

**Pricing:** Custom rates based on duration, location, group size, and scope. Contact me directly to discuss your ensemble's needs.

## NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

1. **Visual hierarchy:** Use clear section dividers between Singing, Speaking, Hybrid, and Ensemble sections. Consider subtle background color shifts or card-based layouts for each pricing tier.

2. **Monthly Plan emphasis:** Use a "Recommended" badge or visual highlight on the Monthly Plan. This is Ted's preferred model and the best value for committed students.

3. **Flagship Series presentation:** These are premium offerings. Consider presenting them as featured cards with slightly elevated visual treatment. Each has a distinct audienceâ€”let visitors self-identify.

4. **PASS Profile callout:** Only the Speaking Flagship Series includes PASS Profile. This is a key differentiator. Link to the PASS Profile page for those who want to learn more.

5. **Per-lesson math:** Display the calculated per-lesson rates to communicate value clearly. This helps visitors understand the savings without feeling like they're being sold to.

6. **Hybrid section:** This may be a smaller audience, but it's a distinctive offering. Position it between Speaking and Ensembles as a bridge category.

7. **Gift Certificates:** Keep this section brief and elegant. Link to Square (or updated payment platform) for purchase.

8. **Ensemble section:** "Contact to discuss" is appropriate here. Make the contact path frictionless.

9. **Responsive design:** Pricing tables should stack gracefully on mobile. Consider pricing cards rather than tables for better mobile experience.

10. **Internal linking:** Link to relevant service pages (Singing, Speaking, Ensembles), PASS Profile page, and Contact page.

11. **TVA brand styling:** This page uses parent brand colors (deep navy, gold accents) since it spans all service lines.
