## INTRO SECTION

**Body Copy:**
The way you speak shapes how your ideas land. Projection, pacing, resonance, confidenceâ€”these aren't abstract qualities. They're skills built on physical foundations that can be understood, practiced, and refined.

I work with professionals, educators, and leaders who want their communication to carry the impact their ideas deserve. With four decades of teaching experience and as the creator of the PASS Profile communication assessment, I bring both practical expertise and a structured framework to this work. Whether you're preparing for a significant speaking opportunity or seeking lasting improvement in how you use your voice, I can help you get there.

## WHO I WORK WITH SECTION

**Section Headline:**
Speaking clients come for many reasons

**Body Copy:**
Most speaking clients arrive with a specific goal in mind. Here are some of the challenges I help people address:

**Upcoming presentations and speaking opportunities** â€” A high-stakes presentation, keynote, or important meeting can create urgency to refine your delivery. I help you prepare by strengthening the vocal and performance elements that make your message compelling.

**Vocal fatigue and strain** â€” If your voice tires easily during long meetings, lectures, or presentations, we address the underlying mechanics. A resilient voice sustains itself through demanding communication without wearing down.

**Confidence and presence** â€” Some people have valuable things to say but struggle to project authority or hold attention. We work on the physical foundationsâ€”breath support, resonance, body alignment, and pacingâ€”that allow your natural presence to emerge.

**Clarity and engagement** â€” Effective communication isn't just about being heard; it's about being understood and holding interest. We refine articulation, pacing, and expressive range to help your ideas connect with listeners.

**Accent modification** â€” For those who want to adjust regional or non-native speech patterns for professional contexts, I offer patient, methodical work that respects your linguistic identity while expanding your communication range.

**Speech pattern challenges** â€” I've helped clients work through various speech impediments and communication obstacles. This work requires care and consistency, and meaningful progress is absolutely possible.

## THE PASS PROFILE SECTION

**Section Headline:**
Understanding your communication style

**Body Copy:**
Your speaking style is as unique as your fingerprint. The PASS Profileâ€”a professional communication assessment I createdâ€”reveals your natural communication patterns: how you process information, engage with others, and express ideas in professional contexts.

PASS Profile is integral to my speaking coaching. The assessment gives us shared vocabulary and precise insight into your authentic communication tendencies. Rather than imposing a generic "good speaker" template, we build on what's already working and address what's getting in the way.

Understanding your natural style means leveraging it intentionallyâ€”knowing when your default approach serves you well and when a situation calls for conscious adaptation.

## HOW LESSONS WORK SECTION

**Section Headline:**
How speaking coaching works

**The first step:**
We begin with a free discovery callâ€”a brief conversation where I learn about your goals and you learn about my approach. From there, we determine together whether it's a good fit.

**Goal-oriented structure:**
Speaking coaching often centers on a specific objective: preparing for an upcoming presentation, building long-term vocal resilience, or developing greater executive presence. I design our work around your particular goals and timeline.

**Lesson format:**
Sessions are typically one hour. Some clients work with me weekly over an extended period; others come for focused, shorter-term engagements. We'll find the rhythm that serves your goals.

**In-person or virtual:**
I teach primarily in person at my studio in Lacey, Washington. Virtual sessions are available and effective for speaking coaching, particularly once we've established a working foundation together.

## WHAT TO EXPECT SECTION

**Section Headline:**
What to expect

**Body Copy:**
Speaking is human-to-human connection. Everything I teach supports that central truthâ€”authentic expression drives impact, and technique serves authenticity.

We work on the physical foundations of voice: breath support, resonance, projection, and articulation. We address pacing, emphasis, and the subtle mechanics of holding attention. And we explore the performance dimensionâ€”how you occupy space, connect with listeners, and bring your genuine self to high-stakes communication.

**A note on scope:**
I focus on the voice and performance elements of speaking. I don't write speeches or develop contentâ€”that's your domain or your speechwriter's. What I help with is how you deliver your message: the vocal quality, physical presence, pacing, and authentic performance that make your words land.

When you understand how your voice works and how you naturally communicate, you can continue developing these skills on your own. That's the goal.

## NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

1. **Hero:** Consider imagery that evokes professional presenceâ€”perhaps abstract or suggestive rather than literal "business speaker" stock photos.

2. **"Who I Work With" section:** Cards or accordion may help scannability. These are distinct client types with different motivations.

3. **PASS Profile section:** Include a visual element (perhaps the PASS logo or a sample visualization). This section connects to the PASS Profile sub-brandâ€”use the appropriate accent colors.

4. **"Note on scope":** This clarifies boundaries without negative framing. Could be styled as a callout or sidebar.

5. **Testimonials:** Add testimonial blocks when professional speaking client quotes are available. Ideal placement: after "What to Expect" or before final CTA.

6. **Internal linking:** Link to PASS Profile page, About page, Pricing page, and Contact/Discovery Call form.
