## HERO SECTION

**Page Title:**
Ensemble Coaching

**Headline:**
Find your voice together

**Subhead:**
Vocal and performance coaching for groups seeking unity, efficiency, and expressive sound.

**Primary CTA:**
Get in Touch

## INTRO SECTION

**Body Copy:**
Strong ensemble singing starts with strong individual skills â€” and with a shared understanding of how voices work together. I help choirs/choruses, quartets, and other vocal groups develop tuning, unity, and authentic performance presence.

Whether you're preparing for competition, working through a specific challenge, or simply want to connect more deeply as an ensemble, I can help your group find its voice.

## WHO I WORK WITH SECTION

**Section Headline:**
Groups of all kinds

**Body Copy:**
I work with ensembles across traditions and contexts. Here's a sampling of the groups I coach:

**Church choirs** â€” From small worship teams to full sanctuary choirs, I help church musicians develop their sound and lead their congregations with confidence.

**Barbershop quartets and choruses** â€” I've spent decades in the barbershop world as a performer, director, and coach. I understand what judges listen for and how to help groups achieve ring, unity, and emotional connection.

**A cappella groups** â€” Whether you're a college ensemble, community group, or professional vocal band, I can help you tighten your sound and elevate your performances.

**School and youth ensembles** â€” I bring nearly 30 years of choral conducting experience in public schools. I know how to meet young singers where they are and help them grow.

**Community choirs** â€” Singing together builds connection. I help community groups develop their musicianship while keeping the joy at the center.

**Competition-focused groups** â€” If you're preparing for contest, I can help you refine the details that make the difference â€” tuning, vowel matching, phrasing, and stage presence.

## WHAT I HELP WITH SECTION

**Section Headline:**
What we work on

**Body Copy:**
Every ensemble has different needs. Here are some of the areas I address:

**Tuning and intonation** â€” When voices lock in, the sound transforms. I help groups understand the mechanics of tuning and develop the listening skills that make it happen.

**Unity and vowel matching** â€” A unified sound isn't about erasing individuality. It's about making intentional choices together. We work on vowel shapes, tone color, and the subtle adjustments that create a cohesive ensemble sound.

**Performance presence** â€” Great singing deserves great delivery. I help groups connect with their audience, tell the story, and bring genuine emotion to the stage.

**Section development** â€” Sometimes the work happens in smaller groups. I coach section leaders and help individual voice parts strengthen their foundation.

**Director support** â€” I work alongside directors to address specific challenges, prepare for performances, or bring a fresh perspective to repertoire.

## HOW IT WORKS SECTION

**Section Headline:**
How ensemble coaching works

**The first step:**
We start with a conversation about your group's goals. Tell me what you're working toward, and I'll share how I might help.

**Flexible formats:**
I design each engagement around what your ensemble needs. Options include:

- **One-time workshops** â€” A focused session on a specific skill or piece of repertoire
- **Ongoing coaching** â€” Regular sessions over weeks or months to build skills systematically
- **Competition prep** â€” Intensive work leading up to contest or performance
- **Sectional coaching** â€” Targeted work with individual voice parts
- **Custom workshops** â€” Sessions designed around your group's specific goals

**Location:**
I can work with your group at your rehearsal space, or smaller ensembles can come to my studio in Lacey, Washington. Virtual coaching is also available for certain types of work.

## WHAT TO EXPECT SECTION

**Section Headline:**
What to expect

**Body Copy:**
I approach ensemble coaching the same way I approach individual instruction: expression first, technique in service of expression.

We'll work on the physical and musical foundations that let voices come together freely â€” breath support, resonance, vowel placement, and listening skills. We'll also explore the performance side â€” how to connect with each other and with your audience, how to tell the story, and how to bring your authentic selves to the music.

I explain the "why" behind what we're doing. When your singers understand how their voices work, they can keep growing on their own. That's the goal.

## CTA SECTION

**Headline:**

## NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

1. **Hero:** Consider imagery that suggests ensemble singing â€” perhaps abstract shapes suggesting voices coming together, or a subtle choir/quartet silhouette. Avoid generic stock photos.

2. **"Groups of all kinds" section:** Cards work well here to help visitors quickly identify their ensemble type.

3. **"What we work on" section:** Could be styled as an accordion or simple list. These are distinct areas of focus.

4. **"Flexible formats" section:** The bullet list helps scannability here â€” visitors want to quickly see if their desired format is available.

5. **Testimonials:** Add testimonial blocks when ensemble client quotes are available. Ideal placement: after "What to Expect" or before final CTA. Quotes from directors and group leaders would be particularly valuable.

6. **Internal linking:** Link to About page, Pricing page (if ensemble rates are listed), Workshops page, and Contact form.
