## SECTION 1: THE AVF WORKSHOP SERIES

**Section Headline:**
The AVF Workshop Series

**Body:**
This is my signature educational offeringâ€”a live, in-person workshop series grounded in the Adaptive Voice Framework (AVF).

The series begins with a shared session for all participants, then continues in two focused paths: one for singers, one for speakers. Each path includes three workshops total (including the shared first session), with each session lasting two hours.

**What participants experience:**
- A clear, system-level understanding of how the voice works
- Hands-on exploration of the Five Pillars and Eight Dials
- Practical awareness they can apply immediately
- Language for describing and developing their own voice
- Confidence in using their voice across varied contexts

The series is designed with a low floor and high ceilingâ€”accessible to beginners while remaining valuable for experienced singers and speakers.

Every participant receives a copy of *AVF: The Adaptive Voice Framework* as part of the experience. The book serves as a shared reference during workshops and a resource for continued learning afterward.

**For speakers:** The speaking path integrates the PASS Profileâ€”my proprietary communication assessment that maps how each participant naturally communicates. This adds personalized insight and language that supports intentional, authentic speaking.

**Subsection: Bring the Series to Your Organization**
The AVF Workshop Series can be delivered as a private experience for your group, retreat, or event. I'll work with you to adapt the format to your needs while maintaining the core learning arc.

**Subsection: Public Workshop Dates**
I'll be announcing public workshop dates soon. If you'd like to be notified when registration opens, let me know.

## SECTION 3: CUSTOM WORKSHOPS FOR ORGANIZATIONS

**Section Headline:**
Custom Workshops for Groups & Teams

- Leveling up: moving beyond "correct" into expressive, artistic singing
- Performance skills and stage presence
- Genuine engagement and authentic performance
