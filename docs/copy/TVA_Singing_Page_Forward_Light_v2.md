## INTRO SECTION

**Body Copy:**
Every singer arrives with different goals. Some want to strengthen their foundation. Others are working through a specific challenge. Some have been singing for years and want to go deeper. Others are just getting started.

I meet you where you are. Lessons are built around your goals, your style, and your voice.

## WHO I WORK WITH SECTION

**Section Headline:**
Singers at every level

**Body Copy:**
I work with complete beginners, experienced performers, and everyone in between. Here's a sampling of who walks through my door:

**Complete beginners** â€” Many of my students arrive convinced they "can't sing." Some haven't sung since childhood. Some have been told they're tone-deaf. I've helped countless singers find their pitch and build confidence from the ground up. Progress often happens faster than people expect.

**Developing singers** â€” If you've been singing for a while and want to grow, I can help you understand what's working, what's getting in the way, and what to focus on next.

**Experienced performers** â€” Whether you're preparing for something specific or refining your craft, I offer a fresh perspective grounded in how the voice actually works.

**Recovering voices** â€” Vocal strain, fatigue, and injury are more common than people realize. Helping singers recover and rebuild is a special focus of mine. I approach this work with care, patience, and a deep understanding of vocal health.

## STYLES & GENRES SECTION

**Section Headline:**
Any style. Your style.

**Body Copy:**
I work across all genres and traditions. The principles of healthy, expressive singing apply whether you're performing classical art song, musical theater, pop, gospel, barbershop, or anything else.

Styles I work with regularly include:

- Classical and art song
- Musical theater
- Pop, rock, and contemporary
- Barbershop and a cappella
- Church music â€” soloists, cantors, praise bands, choir members

If your style isn't listed here, reach out anyway. I've probably worked with it.

## HOW LESSONS WORK SECTION

**Section Headline:**
How lessons work

**The first step:**
We start with a free discovery call â€” a short conversation where I learn about your goals and you learn about how I teach. From there, we decide together if it's a good fit.

**Lesson format:**
Lessons are one hour. Weekly lessons work best for most students â€” that steady rhythm builds momentum and allows real progress to take hold. I also offer flexible options for students whose schedules or circumstances require a different pace.

**In-person or virtual:**
I teach primarily in person at my studio in Lacey, Washington. Virtual lessons are available and work well for some students â€” though for many, starting in person helps us build a stronger foundation together.

## WHAT TO EXPECT SECTION

**Section Headline:**
What to expect

**Body Copy:**
Singing is human-to-human communication. Everything I teach supports that central truth â€” expression drives the voice, and technique serves expression.

In lessons, we build what I call a well-balanced voice. That means developing body alignment, breath coordination, healthy phonation, resonance, and expressive freedom â€” the foundations every voice needs to work freely across any style.

**In early lessons**, I help you understand what's actually happening when you sing. We explore how your body organizes itself, how breath supports sound, and how small adjustments can unlock surprising changes. You'll start to *feel* your voice in a new way.

**As we go deeper**, the work becomes more nuanced. We refine technique, expand range, build stamina, and explore interpretation. But we always come back to the heart of it: what are you trying to say, and how can your voice say it more fully?

**Throughout**, I explain *why* things work the way they do. When you understand your voice, you can keep improving on your own â€” and that's the goal.

## ABOUT AGE SECTION

**Section Headline:**
A note on age

**Body Copy:**
I typically work with singers ages 14 and up. That's when most students have the maturity and focus to get the most from this kind of work.

For younger singers, I often recommend children's choirs as a wonderful way to build skills, develop musicianship, and fall in love with singing. If you're unsure whether your child is ready, feel free to reach out â€” I'm happy to talk it through.

There's no upper age limit. I've worked with singers well into their 70s and beyond. It's never too late to develop your voice.

## CTA SECTION

**Headline:**

The first step is a free discovery call. Tell me a bit about yourself and your goals, and I'll be in touch to set up a time to talk.

**Primary CTA Button:**

## NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

1. **Hero:** Consider a subtle background image or accent that evokes singing without being clichÃ©.

3. **Styles list:** Can be a simple inline list or light visual treatment. Keep it scannable.

4. **Testimonials:** Add a testimonial block here when real quotes are available. Ideal placement: after "What to Expect" or before final CTA.

5. **Internal linking:** Consider linking to About page, AVF page, Pricing page, and Contact/Discovery Call form.

6. **Discovery Call:** Link to scheduling tool or contact form with discovery call option.
